0,Um well not the best Vlog was expecting more
0,No one fucking cares. You're a 12 year old. There comes a point where you're too old for the whole I'm so goofy and fun every second of every day schtick. Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job. Or you can't hair flip your way out of an inevitable date rape charge.
1,you are the best
1,Well done I LOVE! You so much :D
1,I am very happy for this man and we need to spread more love. United we stand divided we fall.

1,hi first
1,Happy vlogiversary
1,MY BOIIII IS #1 TRENDING LMAO
1,*eyyyjooooo Good morning loooganng WHATS POPPPINNN?!?*
1,Good Job on trending Logan.
1,Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine
0,I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't bottom line and if you're still arguing your right to say it well then I have news for you: you're a racist.
1,Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you
1,Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man
1,Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration
0,I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled.
1,And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.
1,What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️
1,Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller
1,Y'all will forgive him for anything lol
1,i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..
0,i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word.
1,I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads
1,Its just a word calm down
1,lets be honest here guys we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol we are confronted with the word on tv music shows friends cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front
1,So humble! It's ok Pewds u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans.
1,Listen listen it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So please  people on the comments stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened.
1,Honestly who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/
0,Social justice warriors need to chill
0,say the N word is not alright at all but people are overreacting waaaaay too much
1,Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix
1,Poods irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful) you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke.
1,It's okay man
0,THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANES AND YET Y'ALLZ ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOME CRACKA WITH A POTTY MOUTH???\n\nSincerely your friendly neighborhood Beaner.
1,honestly I don't care I won't let the word overpower me I always will care about you pewdie!
1,It's ok Felix.
1,Power is the disease.  Care is the cure.  Keep caring for yourself and others as best as you can.  This is life.
0,How many sorrys can one say and still be able to be a part of YouTube
1,Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan Big UP Brah!
0,Dude it's just a word. Maybe ppl shouldn't be getting so butt hurt to be honest.
1,It's not like he said Voldemort. Ain't no evil wizards gonna come out if you say the n word
1,lol its just a word
0,People give power to the word they don't want to hear. If someone says the N word let it slide. Because you're the one who's making it a bigger deal. Stop caring and things will cool off
1,Nice kaws statues dude
0,Pewdiepie... bumass nigga lmao.
1,It's okay pewds
1,Love ya Felix
1,So many people wana see face id security flaw.....
0,The phone itself looks pretty great but it isn't worth the $1000. I'd say wait a while before buying it so the price can lower. By March next year it's probably gonna be the same price as the IPhone 7 is now.
0,1000 ?! . No thank you . Great phone tho . You know how many things I can buy with that
0,I'm not an apple fan had iPhones for years in the past before being overcome with boredom stemming from the stagnant design and underwhelming yearly reveals.
1,Damn I wonder how much longer until we're looking like futuristic movie
1,Apple doing a good job copying Samsung but whatever happened to being innovative? This is just overpriced android with an apple logo.
1,Anyone else appreciate their 6/6s more now?
1,When Google did face unlock several years ago the entire tech press dismissed it as a gimmick. Now it is the best thing since sliced bread.
0,This thing is an orwellian nightmare George Orwell couldn't think of anything better in a drug induced dream. Apple should pay you to buy it.
0,I just need to sell my kidney so I can afford iPhone X :D
0,People here at work think this phone is the best phone ever made and no other phone has the features it will have.....I sit and listen o them at the lunch table browsing YouTube on my S8 smiling.  :)
1,NSA loves Apple users the most.
1,BOUT TIME APPLE!! Been rocking iPhone since the start. Nothing has changed FINALLY SOMETHING GREAT!
1,I remember when Apple was the innovator every one of those features is available on my Samsung 8. They should've just copied the infinity display too...would've made it look much nicer.
1,This phone reminded me of the iphone 3gs so glad that i got my S8+ for $775
1,techrax is gonna be so happy 😂😂😁
0,To me it's just a waste of money.
1,If you look at the top you can see the camera they're using to film the iPhone is seeing the IR blasts coming from the sensor.
1,#Apple have released another #Chinese clone it seems.
1,xbox one x most powerfull console + iphone x= love
1,apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins....
1,You guys are Giving more reasons to swich back to iphone.
0,Made in China for $1000 +? LOL  I can only imagine if it was made in the U.S. Talk about high profit margin. Apple is such a SCAM! \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/apple-earnings-q2-2017-how-much-cash-does-apple-have.html
0,I wanted a better phone if I wanted a camera I would have bought a Nikon.
1,Im gonna buy it just because im gonna get better snap chat filters smh 😤

1,South Korea still wins.
1,samsung galaxy 9 already copy this lol
1,Oooooh looks breakable good thang it's 800 dallars
1,Did samsung make this? Nevermind that would be an insult to samsung and there amazing design team. Android has had these features for years nothing new. Even the Samsung Galaxy s3 had the feature to unlock your phone with your face years ago. Nothing new invented here with Apple.
0,Ahahah lmao

0,It's been a long time CollegeHumor did a video with college humor in it.
0,haha this is depressing haha!
1,song? that shit is so fire
0,What a fucking loser. It took him 9 rounds to beat someone with no boxing skills. No wonder boxing is such a boring and fading sport anymore.

0,i thought it was a shit ad but it was just bad lip syncing
1,That was pretty hilarious but also accurate
1,Always intriguing to me to see how some people get so upset over other people's choice of phone.
1,the best accurate description of  those apple products. :)
1,I really wanna get that emoji machine..
1,lol the dementor part cracks me up.
0,Pay $1000 or $1200 for the 256GB and not even getting half the full screen experience of a galaxy S8 or S8+. With lower resolution a notch that blocks your view and no hard press home button.
1,Do you know what really grinds my gears? The iPhone X in America costs $999 which should be about £760 but they still charge £999.

0,Wouldn't it be the most ironic thing ever if this movie gets James Franco an Oscar nomination?
1,the book was a true literary masterpiece. just like the movie The Room
1,Damn he's so accurate
1,After seeing the teaser I was a little concerned about James Franco's accent but not anymore! That was SPOT ON. This looks fantastic (and not just because of the accent). I cannot wait to see this!
0,This is a great fake trailer!!
1,His performance looks so much better than in the teaser.
1,You'll never be famous in a million years!\n\nBut after that? Holy shit that's such a good quote
1,Best remake ever!
1,He has it all Good look Many frends and also maybe Jonny is Vampyre
1,Can't wait for this! It seems like a modern Ed Wood.
1,I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH
0,Would be much better without all that sexual garbage.
0,I think the room would have been a better movie if Johnny was a vampire
0,Europe is laughing out loud at you americans simply because you elected a bunch of apes to run your country.
0,I hope the media stays on top of Carson's HUD any other federal agencies where woefully unqualified cronies have been installed. Their incompetence and results need to be reported so we can see what happens when people think government and experience in government doesn't matter.
0,The lunatic surrounds himself with other lunatics. America you have become so bizarre...
0,Seriously? You decide to attack the most prominent black republican representative? When we have all these other huge issues in our current government. Wow. I always knew Seth was Racist. He's just open about it now I guess.
0,How did them 6 others survive being stuck in a lift with him without him killing them with boredom lucky it wasn't just one that would be a death sentence for sure.

0,Glad I never had him for a doctor
0,"And this guy is a brain surgeon wonder how many lawsuits against him?  He's despicable!"
0,OMG this dump administration is a nightmare LMAO
0,inept is putting it mildly
0,Lets see. A white privileged white racist Hollywood comedian who's made his career focus on bashing America and its people who live not according to his lifestyle thinks he's doing the white race a solid by attack an intelligent accomplished Black Man who is one of the world best known neurosurgeon. This comedian is a racist asshole.
0,My two biggest disappointments from this event are 1 the iPhone 10 not having a full 2k display and the screen only putting out 625nits of max brightness. That's a little less than half the max brightness of the galaxy note 8. I understand it will  be better than the Note 8 in lots of other ways but I wanted it to match or be better in every conceivable way so the android fans wouldn't have anything to hold on to.
0,So...we're just going to overlook how advanced technology is becoming to describe you? LOCATION FINGER PRINTS FRONT FACING APPLE ID UNLOCK......l'll pass.
