1,"No one fucking cares. You're a 12 year old. There comes a point where you're too old for the whole I'm so goofy and fun every second of every day schtick. Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged, white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job. Or you can't hair flip your way out of an inevitable date rape charge."

1,MY BOIIII IS #1 TRENDING LMAO
1,*eyyyjooooo Good morning loooganng WHATS POPPPINNN?!?*
1,Good Job on trending Logan.
1,Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine
1,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist."
1,Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you
1,Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man
1,Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration
1,"I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled."
1,And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.
1,What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️
1,"Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller"
1,Y'all will forgive him for anything lol
1,i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..
1,i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word.
1,I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads
1,"Its just a word, calm down"
1,"lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front"
1,"So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans."
1,👈 watch by clicking here people's are entertaining
1,"Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened."
1,"Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/"
1,Social justice warriors need to chill
1,"say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much"
1,Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix
1,"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke."
1,It's okay man👌👌
1,"THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANES AND YET Y'ALLZ ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOME CRACKA WITH A POTTY MOUTH???\n\nSincerely, your friendly neighborhood Beaner."
1,"honestly I don't care I won't let the word overpower me, I always will care about you pewdie!"
1,It's ok Felix.
1,Power is the disease.  Care is the cure.  Keep caring for yourself and others as best as you can.  This is life.
1,How many sorrys can one say and still be able to be a part of YouTube
1,"Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!"
1,Dude it's just a word. Maybe ppl shouldn't be getting so butt hurt to be honest.
1,It's not like he said Voldemort. Ain't no evil wizards gonna come out if you say the n word
1,lol its just a word
1,"People give power to the word they don't want to hear. If someone says the N word, let it slide. Because you're the one who's making it a bigger deal. Stop caring and things will cool off"
1,Nice kaws statues dude
1,"Pewdiepie... bumass nigga, lmao."
1,It's okay pewds
1,Love ya Felix

1,How are Chinese going to secure their phones???
1,"The phone itself looks pretty great but it isn't worth the $1,000. I'd say wait a while before buying it so the price can lower. By March next year it's probably gonna be the same price as the IPhone 7 is now."
1,"1,000 ?! . No thank you . Great phone tho . You know how many things I can buy with that"
1,"I'm not an apple fan, had iPhones for years in the past before being overcome with boredom stemming from the stagnant design and underwhelming yearly reveals. Currently loving on my gorgeous s8 plus, HOWEVER, the iPhone X is absolutely beautiful, and for the first time in years I'm actually kind of excited about an apple product. Also can't wait to see how Samsung responds, competition means better products for consumers. Nice work apple:)"
1,Damn I wonder how much longer until we're looking like futuristic movie
1,Apple doing a good job copying Samsung but whatever happened to being innovative? This is just overpriced android with an apple logo.
1,Anyone else appreciate their 6/6s more now?
1,"When Google did face unlock several years ago, the entire tech press dismissed it as a gimmick. Now it is the best thing since sliced bread."
1,"iPhones are for cool hip people, and Samsungs/androids are for fob immigrants and old people, that's what I've noticed"
1,This thing is an orwellian nightmare George Orwell couldn't think of anything better in a drug induced dream. Apple should pay you to buy it.
1,YAS Can't wait to get it! I just need to sell my kidney so I can afford iPhone X :D
1,People here at work think this phone is the best phone ever made and no other phone has the features it will have.....I sit and listen o them at the lunch table browsing YouTube on my S8 smiling.  :)
1,NSA loves Apple users the most.
1,"BOUT TIME APPLE!! Been rocking iPhone since the start. Nothing has changed, FINALLY SOMETHING GREAT!"
1,"I remember when Apple was the innovator, every one of those features is available on my Samsung 8. They should've just copied the infinity display too...would've made it look much nicer."
1,"This phone reminded me of the iphone 3gs, so glad that i got my S8+ for $775"
1,techrax is gonna be so happy 😂😂😁
1,"To me, it's just a waste of money. Samsung galaxy note 8 is better"
1,If you look at the top you can see the camera they're using to film the iPhone is seeing the IR blasts coming from the sensor.
1,"#Apple have released another #Chinese clone it seems. Taking the last 3 years #tech already seen and throwing it into a device twice the price. I haven't seen any #groundbreaking moves from #Apple for many years now, even the computers are being #owned by competitors."
1,xbox one x most powerfull console + iphone x= love
1,"apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit, the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins...."
1,You guys are Giving more reasons to swich back to iphone.
1,"Made in China for $1000 +? LOL,  I can only imagine if it was made in the U.S. Talk about high profit margin. Apple is such a SCAM! \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/apple-earnings-q2-2017-how-much-cash-does-apple-have.html"
1,"*Has features flagship Android phones have had for YEARS such as wireless charging, face unlock, etc. \n\n*Still, hilariously, convinces people that it's revolutionary and is worth over a $1,000\n\nApple - you are brilliant lol"
1,"I wanted a better phone, if I wanted a camera I would have bought a Nikon."
1,Im gonna buy it just because im gonna get better snap chat filters smh 😤

1,"Did samsung make this? Nevermind that would be an insult to samsung and there amazing design team. Android has had these features for years, nothing new. Even the Samsung Galaxy s3 had the feature to unlock your phone with your face years ago. Nothing new invented here with Apple."

1,"Pay $1,000 or $1,200 for the 256GB, and not even getting half the full screen experience of a galaxy S8 or S8+. With lower resolution, a notch that blocks your view, and no hard press home button."
1,"You know  you'll buy it. We'll all buy it. Damn you Apple! But seriously why buy an iPhone 8 when it's almost exactly like an iPhone 7 but slight with 2 more nucleus. Save money for iPhone X or better yet , save your money and in 2 more years the price will drop enough to buy it, after the new iPhone XI, XII, XII, XX come out."
1,"Do you know what really grinds my gears? The iPhone X in America costs $999, which should be about £760, but they still charge £999."

1,Been waiting since Greg's book came out -- I'm so excited.
1,"Next thing you know, Tommy Wiseau is on stage accepting best picture"
1,"wish it was a original story with tommy, instead of him having to remember his earlier project, it's almost like this film is making fun of his work."
1,He does the voice so good
1,I don't know if I have seen anything more spot on in my life
1,"Great trailer, I could not be more excited for this movie! Also, anyone know the song name?"
1,At first I didn't like it but that voice grew on me
1,The greatest movie about the greatest movie.
1,A24 doesn't disappoint.All there movie I seen was good
1,Still can't believe that the original movie was made in 2005.
1,"Justice League, Thor, and Star Wars be damned, THIS is my most anticipated upcoming movie"
1,I have never been more excited for a film.
1,I really wanna watch this!
1,I totally can't wait to see this movie! James Franco does a good job as Tommy Wiseau!
1,I really want to see some kind of video of Wiseau responding to this movie xD

1,"These brothers seem like best friends, wish I could be close to my brother but the sad thing is I don't have one"
1,It's Harry guys he's Spiderman best friend
1,Wouldn't it be the most ironic thing ever if this movie gets James Franco an Oscar nomination?
1,the book was a true literary masterpiece. just like the movie The Room
1,Damn he's so accurate
1,"After seeing the teaser, I was a little concerned about James Franco's accent, but not anymore! That was SPOT ON. This looks fantastic (and not just because of the accent). I cannot wait to see this!"
1,This is a great fake trailer!!
1,His performance looks so much better than in the teaser.
1,You'll never be famous in a million years!\n\nBut after that? Holy shit that's such a good quote
1,Best remake ever!
1,"He has it all, Good look Many frends and also maybe Jonny is Vampyre"

1,"I hope the media stays on top of Carson's HUD, any other federal agencies where woefully unqualified cronies have been installed. Their incompetence and results need to be reported so we can see what happens when people think government and experience in government doesn't matter."
1,"The lunatic surrounds himself with other lunatics. America, you have become so bizarre..."
1,Seriously? You decide to attack the most prominent black republican representative? When we have all these other huge issues in our current government. Wow. I always knew Seth was Racist. He's just open about it now I guess.
1,"How did them 6 others survive being stuck in a lift with him without him killing them with boredom, lucky it wasn't just one that would be a death sentence for sure."
1,So Americans in states that elected Drumpf will need the very 2 agencies - HUD And EPA - that the Drumpf administration vitually dismantled? HAH! Talk about what goes around comes around...
1,"Conservative republicans don't need any of that socialist government aide! They have bootstraps that they pull up to get them out of the muck and when the rich people start trickling their wealth down, all will be right again!"
1,"What an absolute clown.  It's reflective of the state of our nation that a man like Ben Carson could somehow manage to become a leading candidate for president of the United States.\n\nKudos to Ben Carson for his success as a brain surgeon, but it's fair to remember that politics isn't brain surgery - it's far more difficult."

1,I don't know wether to laugh or cry anymore when I see these clips...
1,"Paul Ryan has not yet come to terms with the fact that Ayn Rand is power pornography for teenage boys at a certain stage of aching virginity -- and normal kids get over it.\n \nA lot of people throughout RepublicanLand have variations on the same problem.  They really believe a scientifically incorrect notion, that human beings are independent of one another.  It may feel like that for the lonely teenager, but it's never, ever, true.  \n \nFrom that falsehood, they then build up moralities, generally ugly, histories, false, and a subset of both: self-serving aims or purpose.\n\nThis high-minded purpose gives us a HUD Secretary who is opposed to the Department of HUD, a Secretary of Health (named Price!) who believes that all medicine should be commercial.  You've got a guy over at Environmental Protection who is on the side of the folks continuing to dig the hole deeper.  All with the highest moralities he's been able to find anywhere! \n \nThe good Doctor Carson is really, really, one of the gang.\n\n-dlj."

1,What did he take away from this [trip] today?\nMy luggage!\n\n... but maybe that only adds an extra layer of humour if english is not your mother tongue? ;)
1,"Trump sees HUD primarily as a tool for enriching well-connected real-estate developers, Carson’s combination of loyalty and ignorance may make him uniquely “qualified” for the position. 😠"
1,And this guy is a brain surgeon; wonder how many lawsuits against him?  He's despicable!
1,😆😂😆😂😆 OMG this dump administration is a nightmare LMAO
1,inept is putting it mildly
1,Ugh... 6:30...I'm done LOL
1,2:36 2:55 Lol
1,"Lets see. A white privileged, white racist Hollywood comedian who's made his career focus on bashing America and its people who live not according to his lifestyle, thinks he's doing the white race a solid by attack an intelligent, accomplished Black Man who is one of the world best known neurosurgeon. This comedian is a racist asshole."
1,Will Texans refuse to take government handouts?? And be proud republicans??
1,"My two biggest disappointments from this event are 1 the iPhone 10 not having a full 2k display and the screen only putting out 625nits of max brightness. That's a little less than half the max brightness of the galaxy note 8. I understand it will  be better than the Note 8 in lots of other ways, but I wanted it to match or be better in every conceivable way so the android fans wouldn't have anything to hold on to."
1,"So...we're just going to overlook how advanced technology is becoming to describe you? LOCATION, FINGER PRINTS, FRONT FACING APPLE ID UNLOCK......l'll pass."
1,"Wireless charging, which is awesome to see. It doesn't even feel awesome anymore. It's old news, has been used by companies for 3 years."
1,My first question is: Where do other notification icons go?
1,👈 watch by clicking here you can see People's are entertaining
1,"Look at all these poor Shitsung folks in the comments... Putting personal preference aside, no matter how you slice it, Apple will come out with the new best-selling phone on the market, again. It will be the fastest phone on the market, again. It will have the most used features, largest and most well-developed App Store, and highest adoption rate of hardware & software out of every single phone on the planet. People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years. In the end, none of the debate matters when it's Tim Cook who will be sitting on top of his massive cash pile with the first TRILLION DOLLAR-VALUED company in the world. Can't argue with facts people. BUT, I'm sure you'll find a way!"
1,Apple is really starting to fall off. Galaxy S8 is tops right now next to the Galaxy Note 8.
1,Like this or you'll become gay
1,...From a emoji *uses the poop emoji* this is the best shit from the new iPhone though.\ndude...
1,What if u just show a picture of the iPhone owner's face to unlock the phone lolol
1,I liked the what does the fox say joke
1,"There is no 9, because 7 ate 9! Okay I'll go now...."
1,Talking shit emoji! That is classic! Thank you Apple engineers for making it real
1,"This looks cool enough, but i prefer the older style of iphones more, so i'll probably stick to iphone 8"
1,Did the idea of having a  microsd never crossed apples mind??!? And why isn't there a headphones jack !!!!face Id is nice but why remove the touch Id!????
1,Why dont TMobile sell google phones? Ive seen them get the best ratings for cameras etc but why arent they more mainstream?
1,"as a left handed iPhone user, I´m wondering, if you can go to the Control Center by swiping from the left top corner, too? :/"
1,"*I think the iPhoneX is beautiful, can't wait to get my hands on one. Also interested to see what case companies do for iPhoneX phone cases. 🤔*"
1,New phones rolling out every year with minor design changes to keep hype going and getting more expensive. Over-marketing strategy.
1,This is a really nice phone but the price makes it hard to justify against something like the Galaxy S8 or Essential phone
1,"If you drop these phones, you're lucky if both glass panels don't shatter simultaneously...screen and back. But iPhone buyers have enough money anyway...so it hits no beggars. lol"
1,hahhaha you fool...ass hole ...there is nothing new
1,"Beautiful design but if I'm going for anything, it will be keeping my 6s and getting the Apple Watch with cellular"
1,"People complaining about the notch are imbeciles. How else were they supposed to go full screen and still fit the speaker grille, sensors & front camera in there? iPhone X is gorgeous, imo."
1,they took gesture tech from blackberry 10 phones. BB was really good. Missing it.
1,Hats off for the owners of Apple for all the money they are going to make with their new overpriced gadgets.
1,samsung alredy have all these new features
1,Intro sounds like it belongs in Splatoon. :P
1,"I have Apple products but I can’t justify paying $1,000 for this phone. Seems like they need to bring in people who are more inventive."
1,My galaxy S8 is still better. Switching to android from Apple has been my best decision this year.
1,It's cool but not a 1000 bucks cool
1,EVERYONE holds their phone by the sides....WHY THE FUCK is the power button on the side instead of the top to prevent accidental pressing and having to unlock the phone AGAIN!?!?!?!   (super major gripe with every phone out there....designers are morons)
1,I worry about certain games that require you to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to play and that might constantly trigger the back to home screen function.
1,the iPhone 8... skips to 10...\nWindows 8... also skips to 10...\n;)
1,Hell man I'm tripping on a 1000 bucks really
1,"I prefer iPhone 8 over 10, ‘cause iPhone 10 looks like one of those android phones with a similar design. iPhone 8 looks more of a iPhone instead of 10."
1,Finally i will be able to buy iPhone SE
1,Everyone just getting all their new Apple stuff while i still cant afford the actual fruit smh -_-

1,Police dogs do so much they should be appreciated more. They are so loyal the breeds are typically Malinois and sometimes German shepherds. Malinois are more agile but German shepherds are more powerful. I live shepherds a tad more.

I know that you have to keep track with the hype but quantity also require quality . Just,before joking , take a 2-3 seconds of silent ,ok? appreciate if you guys take time to read my comment"

1,"Raph was every 40 year old part time, non-degreed student who still refers to freshmen girls as fresh meat."
1,"So I used to live right in front of the tour room aka mint condition room. Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates."
1,Honestly I'm three weeks into college and i want to kill myself.
1,"What about the construction of buildings that actually sound cool, but will never be completed until after you finish college."

1,she was so cute omg throw this in the garbage xD 🤣🤣❤❤
1,I'm so glad I'm an old fart who never has to go to school again. Woo Hoo!
1,Yo this was funny af
1,"I went to Boston University.  When I would have my spring break, I would pretend to be a Harvard student and go to their classes.  Harvard was fun.  Their lectures were more interesting than ours, which was totally unfair.  I even gave someone else directions one time.  MIT was depressing/suffocating though.  It was a combination of the people and atmosphere.  I only pretended to go there for half a day."
1,Is it just me or is Rekha really cute?
1,"But for real, why is it that all the science buildings are hideous?"
1,Wow this collegehumor video is actually pretty good. And it's even about college

1,The Asian dad was classic lolol
1,"I love idolizing football or basketball teams, and would gladly sell my soul in support.  Would I make it at a University like this?"

1,Honest? I see no random color hairgender studies or lesbian dance theory activist or 98% white blm crowd or snowflakes running from safe space to safe space scared they might run into a FACT.   lets see the real version......
1,"What, no joke about how you can't apply if you are going to call a woman a woman, because that is offensive to those who sexually identify as Attack Helicopters, trapped in a womans body?"
1,Mayweather’s smile is beautiful.
1,Not many men are this honest.  I salute him for that😂😂
1,OMG... He really is a nice guy...
1,"Holy shit this was good!! D-Don't do'em like that , Diego! Lmao."
1,If jakes dumbass videos can be  first on trending THIS BETTER BE FIRST ON TRENDING TOO
1,Some of yall think Mayweather only cares about money and yes it is true but thats simply because he didnt have that much money back then so now he feels so proud of himself and like to talk money
1,Floyd is such an awesome guy
1,Lol! He's funny! He's got seven women that's not right!
1,This made me like floyd mayweather even more

1,"this was so hilarious ...Diego the best puppet ever!! <3 when can we see Diego getting his divorse,, I honestly feel so sad for a puppet"
1,Whatever team's winning
1,Floyd seems more comfortable and well spoken with a puppet more than he does a real interviewer!?
1,"awesome! your a genius, makes me happy!"
1,This is so good; thanks Floyd Mayweather this is another side of you I have not seen. It's so refreshing.
1,Haha this was cute 😂😂👀...deigo is hilarious..

1,Having one girl is too close to having none? What kind of philosophy is that? Did Aristotle say that
1,Jimmy's a natural born killer. That axe went right in the femoral artery. That board would be a blood geyser if it were human.
1,jimmy did awesome throw 👏👏👏
1,I really can't tell if what she's wearing is super comfortable or insanely uncomfortable. It looks so soft but also feels like it's a body suit designed to make you itch. ******rich people clothes*****
1,"ball shot then head shot, nice Jimmy!"
1,the first axe looks like a dick
1,Really? Did she challenge him? I don't believe it
1,She looks so hot with those goggles.
1,"Jennifer was mad because, I wasn't there to have sex with her. That's the only reason she was mad cause I wasn't there to c her get naked and suck my dick. Jennifer Lawrence is so fuckin cute and so fuckin hot and that's the only reason I want to have sex with her right now. I LOVE JENNIFER LAWERENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Jennifer is the fucking best
1,There was -11 for the part that Jimmy hit in the hmm....So technically Jennifer wins
1,It's so cute that she's peeved she didn't win.  She's def got a strong competitive streak in her.
1,"Awww man. Guys, guys...\n*sighs*\nLook, I can show you how to throw a darn axe. You gotta put your lower body into it."
1,Jimmy's super competitive with games. I bet he spent all his free time the last 2 days practicing his axe throwing...
1,"If it was a real human body, he would have been split into exact half ! what a precision Jimmy, well done"
1,I was waiting for him to steal Carsons old line....
1,Jimmy is always so lucky with gamesss😂
1,"Lucky for Katniss, during the hunger games, the axe was not the only weapon available. I think Jimmy was sharking with his first throw. Obvious that he had been practicing a little with his last 2 throws. Nice shot."
1,"I just knew they were gonna start shoving this fugly bitch in our faces again. We had a nice break from her, but she just had to jump back into the limelight again."
1,Jimmy should challenge her to a dick taking contest. Spoiler alert: Jimmy wins.
1,It's funny how the half of the Roots have been cleaned up
1,Guess why this looks familiar! Especially at 1:10\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0L5QC9ZJkM8
1,"2:14 sounds like some porn, naa it's just Jennifer Lawrence  who's really into axe throwing"
1,Would have been funny if they blurred out the axe handle.
1,Who thought this would be a good idea?
1,So hunger games training did not come handy here.
1,Man win every time woman suck
1,Jennifer's shoes though :))))
1,Throwing a 2 hander requires more distance
1,Lmao wow 😂
1,Nice try dumb ass JLaw
1,Cool 😂😂😂
1,The Hunger Games made me  believe that Jennifer actually had a good aim
1,Hi him I want you to know that me and my Dumb liberal friends love you buddy
1,i would be sexually aroused if SHE would point at me with a giant axe\n#50ShadesOfaHillBilly
1,How revolting can rich people be?
1,"Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others don’t? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities?"
1,MTV trump donating to charity is racist\nTherefore mtv is now promoting nazis\nYour welcome
1,"Why are people like “Rich people asking the poor for money.” You’re basically saying, “Lets not help other human beings in need because the rich should be able to take care of it themselves.” News flash, they are donating their money, but you are NOT entitled to THEIR money! Just like you work hard for yours, they worked hard for theirs. Just giving yourselves reasons to be stingy and lazy."
1,"most of these rancid celebs ARE PAID to show up... dont support them, and  donate to better charities"
1,"Most of the deviation videos were places in Dickinson, yet they said it was all Houston. we need help in Dickinson come on guys!"
1,Wow thats cool they invited big girl with a powerfull voice. Hope all the people get there money
1,Colbert? Really? I wonder how many people said FU and changed the channel as soon as they saw that asshole.
1,I wonder what the administrative overhead is for this organization? I would rather see these celebs roll up their sleeves and do some actual work.. You would be better off donating to Mercury one 100% of your donation goes to the cause at hand.
1,"If celebrities, business owners and VIPs involved donated $100k each you would reach the goal hours ago.  Donald Trump donated $1 Million, the Kardashian Family 500k.  Also I really really really hope the money goes to the victims not an organization or government."
1,This is exactly what the US deserves after a decade of imperialism and war-mongering. Die!
1,anybody notice the colors of the two hands of the original image? is it the BLACKS being helped by the COMMUNISTS? hmmmm.
1,"Bump that. Always the same- aome bs devastation via crisis,& then another fundraiser?? How much of the proceeds go directly towards feeding, clothing, ans possibly re-building/housing how many thousands that have bewn displaced?? Somoene please tell me. Preferrably somekne who actually has inside info. ahmehrikkkan redd kross,=🐂💩 And\n\nand plenty others of those supposed feed the hungry damn infomercials. #GTFOH #Want to really help??"
1,"Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves. God bless 💕"
1,This is amazing 😉
1,THANK YOU SOO MUCH
1,Another Celeb Filled Scam.
1,Irrelevant celebrities begging for money for a scam charity lol
1,"Yesterday a received the Hand In Hand donation calls and omg I was amazed of how many people wants to help, people with $1000 dollars, others with $10 but they really wanted to help, I still have faith on this world ❤️"
1,"This was honestly so powerful, my family and I we're sitting in the dark listening to this with a radio and not 10 minutes after it went off the electric came back 🙏"
1,I personally got affected my Irma and seeing this makes me so happy that people care❤
1,Like the choir the black and yellow is hot theyre also great on the vocals plus lean on me is a classic gospel song & shouts to the king ray charles and i want to send my love to every body every z.bb.al that went thru the havey disasters.
1,So full of hope and optimism!
1,Couldn't skip not even one second. it was all meaningful and unforgettable....
1,Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
1,$14 million! Keep it going! Help good people have a chance to rebuild.
1,"Forget about raving about your favorite stars, or putting down the government and the Presidents- current and past.  This event was about the displaced people and the help they need.  God expects us to love one another and this is a very good place to start!  Did all of you who have left comments about your stars or bad feelings about the government donate anything or are you just wasting energy that could be used in helping others?  Stop for a second and think what you can do to help your fellow man, woman and child who might be in need.  Maybe you cannot give the $25 they are asking for, but you can give smaller amounts- every amount is accepted."

1,whould have been amazing had Heidi selected the tweet and not mr fingers pasting it onto the board.
1,"Hello, I am Theresa Williams After being in relationship with Anderson for years, he broke up with me, I did everything possible to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem. His email: drbiyaspelltemple19213@gmail.com you can email him if you need his assistance in your relationship or any other Case.\n1) Love Spells\n2) Lost Love Spells\n3) Divorce Spells\n4) Marriage Spells\n5) Binding Spells\n6) Breakup Spells\n7) Banish a past Lover.\n8.)

1,Nice trick he didnt predict anything :) if you can see in the minute 3:32  in the paper there was a sticker under his fingers when she said stop he sticks the twitter and he didnt give her the paper it was still in hand ( paper) :)
1,"I've heard way too much Cheese, Rome, and Ellen today...."
1,"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding. That's usually where the magic happens."
1,"This seems more true then before, have improvement"
1,Mel changes her hair like most people change their clothes @_@
1,Yes his trick is obvious. But me personally. I like his presentation. I like how he always starts the presentation with something random (how did he known howie's passcode?) And then they way he talks and the way he looks and how humble he is. And I also like how he's not a singer. He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive.
1,This is mind blowing. But we all know a singer or a dancer will win
1,I know how he did it. When he grabbed the paper that Mel picked he had a little piece of paper in his hand it put it over the paper that was grabbed off the table and just made sure his finger was at the spot when they said stop.
1,I noticed he took the paper with his left hand and then for a split second with his right he put something on the paper. It was a small sticker .notice how he kept his right hand on THE paper the whole time?
1,"this guy is part of the show. hes like a cast. hes not gonna win. Hes just like a filler, to keep the show entertaining."
1,What kind of demon is he
1,"Ok, he sure is very good at messing around with unconcious mind"
1,"Cool but, I got a triple kill in BO2 with an RPG once"
1,Hello Americans..please let this man win..A magician deserves to win AGT 2017...enough of singers..
1,This guy deserves to win. My opinion
1,is the best M best on this planet
1,I predict that he will win the show.
1,Simple. Tiny sticker on his finger. He places it when Heidi zeroes in on her chosen area on the card. Look at when its zoomed in. The choices are literally smaller than the size of his fingertip making it easily stickable on the card.
1,The singers are great the dancers are amazing but this my friends IS TALENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ONE OF A KIND! I am shoook!
1,Can u guys help me get 200 subscribers I'm so close please I'll be so happy
1,It's not about the piece of paper in his hand. It's about how he is able to mentally convince an entire audience that magic is real with a simple trick.
1,this guy is a global threat lol
1,"Mell looks like a better looking Elsa.....\n\nFor those of you who don't know who Elsa is, shes my ex-friend....\n\n\n\n\ncold hearted bitch😒"
1,WOW. You guys better give him a 10.
1,"I figured it out. At 3:06, after Mel hands him the card, he takes his right hand out of his pocket and puts what I would assume a sticker on there and then forces her to stop on Ellen, Rome, Cheese. Still a fantastic performance!"
1,"MAGIC TRICK REVEALED:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe palms a sticker containing the desired tweet Ellen Rome Cheese, then at 3:17 he rubs the sticker on to the card and forces Heidi to read the tweet even though she didn't pick that tweet."
1,This act wasn't that good... To do the trick he had a sticker in his hand and when Heidi said stop he places the sticker on top of the previous tweet so he already knew it was going to be Ellen Rome Cheese
1,OMG!!! I'm Impressed!!! Now we can believe in Magic XD
1,He's winning
1,Cool AF
1,OMFG.... This Man Is Incredible 👏👏👏
1,WOW ! 😎
1,AUTOMATICALLY WINS. *FATALITY.*
1,Illuminati confirmed
1,Klu di indo ini sudah bisa disajikan sama om romy rafael.. cuma ini penyajiannya lbh keren njir.. nice..
1,If you notice when he picks up the paper that Mel gave him he puts a sticker on. And then he forces the stop by hiedi which is not hard for any decent magician
1,Are you fair?
1,I love Apple
1,Lol still no aux. no fingerprint sensor. apples behind samsung once again. Sup Jon!!!
1,Favourite feature:   iPhone X itself. :)
1,https://goo.gl/2xE8fM\na true site to win££££££££££££££££\nموقع صادق للربح
1,It looks soo good 😍😍😍
1,Nice phone
1,Wow i want that iphone 10th. 😘😘😍😍
1,awesome
1,Traffic light camera
1,The most excited and awaited iphone XD
1,I bet everybody wants to get that phone but are talking shit just because they can't afford it :-)
1,The facial recognition for sure. Plus the entire casing and the big screen. Loving those with the iPhone 10
1,Nova launcher does that they copied android with this 999 bucks atached a 6 core really most high end android are 8 core or higher
1,Is  reachability  gone now from iPhone X ?\nIf it is so then i think Apple has dropped an important feature. 😐\nIt is much more required now in that screen size
1,> hands on > most of the video is a man in a room
1,Giveaway? Can't wait. I'm new to the apple family haha
1,"Pause at 0:28, you're welcome."
1,Everything? :/ There are many other things I'd like to see
1,i love everything about the iPhone X (ten)!!!!!!
1,Jonathan Morrison and iJustine want the silver X. Classic look. I know what Jon Rettinger is getting... 😉\n\nLess fingerprints will be shown in most indoor lighting.\n\nCan be recognized easily as a X with the vertical camera hump and not be mistaken as a black 7 from afar. \n\nKinda a throwback to the two-toned original iPhone that helped launch their YouTube/tech career.\n\nSilver X it is.  Even my space gray SE isn't consistently all black from front and back and it's the most beautiful iPhone ever made.
1,The last time I was this early the iPhone still had a headphone jack
1,"Wayyyy to expensive, I'm completely neutral to all smartphones but the iPhone X is just a Galaxy S8 that costs $300 dollars more"
1,So no touch id? Wow what a trash a phone
1,"I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks."
1,I have a feeling that everyone you know will be able to unlock your phone with face id cos they can just hold up a picture of your face and it will just unlock
1,Cool! But that price tag tho...
1,Screen!! hands down is my favorite feature of iPhone X
1,The iPhone x wipes your butt while you watch videos the iPhone x is garbage and rubbish and has no real actual crap to offer you but go ahead and spend a grand on me I am the iPhone x I will know your secrets and I will keep your soul I will tell you that there are new things when there really isn't my megapixels have not changed and stayed the same since the iPhone 5 yes my camera can now clearly detect a pimple on ones butt. just remember the iPhone X is the best and I am your phone God come to me my Apple peasants please Apple peasants come to me iPhone x needs your money
1,I find it hilarious how all of the new iPhone's new specs have all been used before
1,Do. U think u be able to pre order unlocked one as well ???
1,hey @jonathanmorrison does the  iphone give away apply to someone that doesnt live in the US? im from bahamas lol
1,"....How much did it cost to get into an event like this? It couldn't have been free. Either you get in there by knowing someone (or being that someone), or you pay a lot of money. \n\n...Either way, I would never go to one of those events. And I'll never pay that much for a phone. Absolutely unreasonable in my books."
1,It looks so good 😍
1,I love iPhones....Is it worth spending $1000 for the x? I'm leading on the no. I love all the features...but it's cost the same as a computer. 😕
1,Is the camera better than Samsung note 8
1,Love all the specks on the new iphone X
1,Omg the iPhone X is soooo cool I really love it
1,"Ahh my top all favorites for the iPhone X is the dual 12-megapixel camera, and the placement of the flash was a genius thing. This way the flash is evenly distributed over both cameras. This will definitely result in high-quality pictures. Next is the Facial ID, now that is impeccable!! Also the 5.8 OLED Display..OMG, magnificent!! I love this upgrade!! \nThnx for the review Jonathan!"
1,Love that some of my favorite YouTubers all worked together to get footage!! YAY!!!😄
1,Your video is on point as usual. I'm excited for the Face Id feature.  Thanks for the video!!
1,love the new phones
1,I love the sharpest display and facial recognition with brand new camera features.
1,$1000 for entry level X?  No thanks.. the 8 Plus looks like the better buy...
1,The way you talk its so professional 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏻
1,Yeah I can’t stand that top bar it’s so goddamn terrible looking!!!!!. For me it’s not about the money price I will be definitely going for the 256 gig. I don’t know if I can leave touch ID. But that top bar I just can’t deal with it watching movies playing games I don’t know what the hell Apple was thinking about leaving the top Bar like that.. And the Face ID I still can’t trust it. There was a video where a guy puts the phone up to an Apple employee’s face and unlocks the phone. Without his permission. So what stop’s the police or anybody trying to Unlock your phone without your permission. I still feel like the face ID has some security flaws..
1,I can just say that display is finally beauty.And it's made by Samsung Not bad.
1,Lol all the people walking behind Jonathan and the giving the the look xD
1,I've actually been using charcoal powder for a couple of months now and noticed a HUGE improvement with the whitening and general hygiene of my teeth.

1,Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
1,Stumbled upon this in trending - Hilarious! AND a GREAT simple way to cook a chicken breast! Nicely done!
1,"Hey! I have a small YouTube account and I'm struggling to take off, I'd really appreciate if you could take a look. If it's not your type of thing then you don't have to subscribe I understand but it's worth a try!😊"
1,Where have you been My whole Life?
1,I don't trust this channel\n\nThe songs sound like Onision reject songs
1,You know he's a good cook when he's got dem ants 0:50
1,"yooo your harmonies are starting to get really good, mixtape soon?"

1,Subscribed xD this is way too funny
1,Is this my life now? I can barely make a sandwich and now I'm learning how to chanejangle like the best of them. At this point I hold my onion at such a high appreciation I think my body temperature is around three-fungle degrees
1,This is actually so helpful! I'm moving into my first apartment and this is a quick easy and cheap recipe. Thanks!

1,nice
1,RETARDED AT BEST
1,Wtf did I just watch rofl...
1,Stare into your ears lol
1,00:34 he signed it YSAC 😅 so adorable
1,"If you are in danger, scream Denise Hemphill's name real loud. I will be on the premises at all times, and I will come a-runnin'. Now, let's just say you screamed Denise Hemphill's name and I do not come a-runnin'. That means I'm not on the premises."
1,"The downside side of downsizing house cats dogs the occasional bird of prey just became Godzilla and you're now on their menu, elephants rhinos cows horses became living natural disasters, a Sprinkle or a daytime shower just became a deluge of biblical proportions thunderstorms became hurricanes and dust devils F5 tornadoes, firecrackers just became moab's and a weapon just became a nuke"
1,"this looks so silly, but so fun, im glad its not a serious movie, more of a light hearted comedy with a serious real life problem that effects us today, and will do moreso in the future, but done in a non-serious tone, im gonna watch this :P"
1,Matt Damon was my celebrity crush when I was like 14 lol
1,"Just like teleportation, it's probably more like cloning ones body in a smaller form then incinerating the original."
1,"What an original premise! I'm definitely going.\nAlso, Kristen Wiig is going places!\nSNL really is a talent factory..."
1,the idea of the movie is great but what about Birds insects rain animals in general and aren't you going to die from hypothermia if you're outside in the winter hopefully they explain some of this otherwise great idea
1,My first thought was that this looks like a crapy comedy movie but it looks more like a interesting light hearted movie instead. I'm going to keep my eye on it and if it gets decent reviews I'll go to see it.
1,"Interesting, though now since they are small wouldn't they be further down on the food chain and wild animals, insects and such would most likely kill them?"
1,"I love the idea except one thing - INSECTS, THE ANIMAL KINGDOM NO."
1,"Wow can't believe I never thought of this for the overpopulation problem I really want to see this movie ,I want to see how this all plays out"
1,Very interesting. Randomly clicked on this and was not disappointed. Can anyone tell me the name of the song?
1,@ last a new film with some meaning!
1,This is a cute way of getting people on board with voluntary genocide for the betterment of Earth.
1,"I love the concept.  I couldnt help thinking though, what happens when it rains/hails, would it wipe out a city?  What happens if a band of fire ants move in? It will be interesting to see if they address any of the issues they would have."
1,So... the adult version honey I shrunk the kids?
1,"If it's got Kristen Wiig in it, then its got me in the cinema. (Also it looks really interesting.)"
1,Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
1,Really curious to see how the premise of this movie is construed as an Aesop. There are so many ways this movie can be manipulated to present a specific moral standpoint.
1,Saw the thumbnail and thought this looks stupid. Watched the trailer and I'm very intrigued. Good for Paramount to pick up something with a quirky premise :)
1,I think the whole shrinking process is an inside project orchestrated by the government to kill as many people as possible with efficiency.
1,Looks great! So what happens top his wife?
1,i honestly thought this movie was about losing jobs. thumbs up if you did too.
1,"The document he is signing says defendant, I'm guessing his wife dies getting shrunk and he gets in some legal situation metaphor on little guy against the big guy"
1,"1:34. \n\nLol. That's the first thing a man will check, all okay down there and women would check if both of them are okay up there."
1,This is like the modern version of honey I shrunk the kids LMAO 😂
1,But then you have rid all the current furniture and current cars and buildings have to be renovated etc.....isnt that more pollution and landfill
1,"Isn't population implosion more of a existential crisis facing humanity than over population? I love Matt Damon, wish he'd do sci-fi movies based on real or likely hypothetical situations again. Such as contagion."
1,Great. A film about my downstairs.
1,"Square Cube Law.. but I don't really care, it is a fun idea of a movie."
1,Soooo what happens when a spider comes to visit their town? Lol
1,I see the live-action Pikmin movie is looking great
1,"I love the picture of Paramount, where did you take the photo?"
1,Imagine the sexual possibilities...
1,Shrunk - https://youtu.be/Wn7RE8zycJQ ;D
1,What lol
1,This looks cute. Nice popcorn type movie.
1,WOW WOW WOW
1,that vodka bottle!;)

1,Is nobody talking about the fact that Fergie has not aged a day in her life?
1,This sounds like it would be a good ringtone
1,Two women id love to have a 3 some with
1,"Fergie didn't need to put Nicki on the video, by herself she slain it totally, love to hear her rapping too, thumbs up!"
1,I wanted to like this. I really did. Fergie is so much better than this though.
1,It's so surprised
1,Well idk what I just watched buuuuutttt.... tbh i liked Fergie's singing in the bridge and loved it after 3:01 but tbh i really didn't like the chorus.... but nicki slayed in her long ass weave as always <3
1,First Nicki verse in a while that hasn't been hot garbage
1,I love fergie but these lyrics are trash
1,Watch and learn? Damn right she did from Madonna. #GurlPlease

1,Here we go with the ghetto talk and culture. Cultural degeneration is still going strong.
1,really girl? Best cheap video ever!!!
1,wow... cant wait to see them live!!!
1,Fergie's flow much better than  flow of many new rappers
1,Fergie looks so good with that suit and tie <3 she's beautiful
1,Fergie has a video spoectacular i also liked to see how it put enough rhythm to the song and at the same time quite sensuality
1,It was worth the wait \m/
1,"I really like this song!! I like that Nicki had clothes on and looked beautiful. Fergie could have done the same then it would have been a perfect video. Other than that, I like the song a lot."

1,How do so few people die? Like OMG that's still decent. 1800 died in New Orleans in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina.
1,Today two of chickens were attack by a coyote\n\nI would like to say I loved them \n\nThis had to happen right when they were starting to lay eggs
1,Cuba's president nice joke
1,and how many died from smoking since then?
1,"Only 10, that's not bad at all"
1,Every one let's help the best we can it's time to make a change!!
1,Here it's the real part Cuba get 50% european and 30% Canadian tourist. Not Americans alow in Cuba but yea America it's the only country the world expect to give aid and food to Cuba. How ironic..
1,"I can't believe people are actually complaining that it was 10 people. 10 people could have been your loved ones or even you. They are brothers, sisters, mothers, aunts, uncles to someone. If you have nothing positive to say. Leave."
1,"Far-left journalists before Irma = Cuba has the best protocol to protect their citizens, they will have no casualties\nAfter Irma = . . . . . . . . . ."
1,"Best of luck to Cuba. As a south Floridian, I've experienced wilma and now Irma. Both felt identical in damages. Depressing aftermath for both storms but blessed that both were far from catastrophic. Irma was a storm that only hit the Caribbean hard. I can only imagine how bad it is in Cuba right now. Sending my condolences to the lives lost."
1,"They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep"
1,"it’s so sad that many people have never experienced how cubans live . i, myself am cuban . i was born there but moved to america. many people don’t understand that simple evacuation is hard . and with trump not letting cubans enter america easily is much worse . and for the people saying 10 is nothing . it’s A LOT. most cubans are often acquainted with many people and everyone is very caring for everyone else and people are very close. So 10 is a lot even though it seems like nothing here ,it’s a lot for Cubans. And in regards that Cubans barely have any health , medicine or basic living supplies most Cubans die of diabetes and many other diseases and it’s very sad."
1,"It broke concrete buildings, prayers to Cuba!"
1,almost my whole family lives in cuba i pray for them\n\n1 like = ok im not even going to do it
1,noone can seriously think this wouldnt happen lol. throw a large storm into an area with shacks and dirt poor people. tis life
1,"10 is actually a good number, considering it was the strongest storm to ever hit Cuba. And let she honest, Cuba isn't exactly a country of incredible infrastructure and solid buildings. So the death toll could have been astronomical."
1,"What, I can't hear you. I was attacked by sonic weaponry...... sorry, good luck."
1,It didn't happen in america so we don't really care.
1,"People's believe in God of Sun ..and God of Sunday ... thats name of that God is Nemrod and he is in charge to help you :-(  if you pray to him...he will make to you more and more destruction...Pray to really God ,God of Abraham Isaac and Jakob ..and you can be safe .."
1,I can't take this comment section people are literally saying lol
1,Cool just give me my edge points already
1,Maybe they should get rid of the whole dictator prob
1,God bless the ones who suffer please believe and love him 1 pray one bless to someone in\nwho's suffering
1,My best friend is Cuban 😥
1,"Stay Strong People, whatever it is please stay strong for God and your loved ones he blessed you with"
1,"And since you watched this videos hundreds have died from hunger, depression, drinking and diabetes. good job this is just for the ratings and views since it's in right now"
1,Dear god 10 people how will they make it better
1,We are strong and we will get over it...come on my people lets get up one more time 👍💪
1,fly high 🙏🏻
1,10? More like fidget spinners!!!!
1,"LOVE ONE ANOTHER\nPEACE, LOVE, UNITY, PROSPERITY, CALM, WISDOM, FORGIVE, RESPECT, HONESTY, TOLERANCE, \nGOOD HEALTH, LIBERTY, CLEAN ENERGY, SELF CONTROL, EQUALITY, INCLUSION, PARDON, PATIENCE, JOY, STAY SAFE, WELL-BEING, KINDNESS"

1,Finally good. Music
1,Robert Ritchie has proven that he is for Detroit and for Michigan. I support his ideas. Kid is about living life and loving your friends and family.\nMuch love my brother.\nGot some great fishing downriver right now. Elizabeth park.
1,this makes me wanna crack open a warm keystone and fuck my sister
1,Funny how im on a mountain and in Tennessee.
1,"Ugh, always a yankee trying his best to be pass for a rebel. Next time you feel like such a badass, go talk trash about Lemmy to a group of Motörhead fans. Have some respect, you pandering talentless redneck."
1,I like seeing people get triggered. Kid Rock is my new hero. Him and Trump. I still cant stand Ted Nugent tho and Im from Michigan. Ted's a doofus
1,Thanks Kid for the variety of great music you throw down. I love it!
1,"What a shitty song. Sounds as incoherent as Jake Paul with a country accent. You bro country hipster you've have no idea what a country song is, listen to some actual country song and notice the great themes they usually capture, just drunkenly slurring out a few familiar words doesn't make it a country song."
1,I Really Love Kids Voice.
1,When your next senator releases a new song...
1,Just need spiked tea and women to grab by the pussy! Anit nothing like a Tennessee mountain top!
1,What about your new song Engine 9 with Yelawolf when does that drop?
1,Thank you for the good music!!!
1,"Hello Everyone,  the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.  JESUS CHRIST is Coming! Confess and Repent from your Sins Today.  Give your life to JESUS CHRIST as your Lord and Savior now don't wait Time is Short.  We are living in the End Days!  JESUS CHRIST is Coming!  \nSo is Judgement!  Heaven is Real and Hell is Real.  JESUS CHRIST is your only Hope to Salvation.   JESUS CHRIST loves you. Thank you God bless"
1,Good lord I can't imagine this dumbshit in a position of power. At least Donald Trump was a successful businessman
1,Been on that mountain top!!         ...ya betta ask somebody.
1,EAST TENNESSEE GIRLS LOVE KID ROCK!!!!
1,Just hours after mentioning how Detroit and Michigan are his home and beyond compare. He releases Tennessee Mountain top.... Well alright.
1,Can't wait to hear it live - awesome rock and country don't get any better - obtained - on my ipod - now - windows down and loud as it will play - awesome
1,I love this! It sounds close to Blue Jeans and a Rosary. #kidrockforussenate
1,"I ain't much much of a kid rock fan or really any kinda guy that would listen to his shit except maybe that picture song he did a long while back. But... This song means a lot to me. I'm a born n raised Tennessee boy outside of Memphis and even though some parts I lived wasn't country it was still a lot like these lyrics. After my service with the Navy I ended up moving out here to California because of someone I thought was an angel and a friend, still... I do miss a lot in Tennessee and one day I'll come back home. This song seems to tell me something like it's a sign I should move back... The universe has a funny way to reveal things"
1,Whooohooo!!!!!!  I LOVE 💏💖THIS SONG!!!!!!
1,"This is Americana right here, folks."
1,I will never forgive you for your rendition of sweet home Alabama...
1,Sure trending with only 50k
1,like the song...  but saying hip hop had no soul is funny i think he was talkin about his own hip hop he tried to do lol...but he made money off of it
1,Kid Rock is a racist according to most people on the West Coast.  Is that a fact?
1,Why does this sound like an ad? 😂😂
1,Absolutely love an thanks for putting up.. not trying to be a ass but it's O'Keefe not oh Keith... O'Keefe is Great music school that's the only reason I wrote this!!!! But thanks for the video an of course I could be wrong....
1,The Chargers have too many defensive weapons to be that timid early on. They honestly have the potential to be a top 5 defense in the league.
1,"The broadcasters were horrible, thanks for making us feel like you don't care about us, ESPN. Rex and some random lady, please hire an actual crew in the future. Somehow you make a great Broncos game feel like a chore. But it wasn't, was it? This was one of the best games all week!\n\nOn the Broncos front, we might have made a huge mistake by cutting TJ Ward and will be drafting Safety high next year. We still need a better O-line in places. Siemian improved a lot, Jamal Charles is old. Poor Jamal."
1,Rivers waits too long to get desperate..it takes 2 to 3 quarters to figurr out what is going on.  They use too many short runs down the middle.very predictable..He needs to throw more long balls and use Gates more often.
1,My west is looking good
1,"Commentator was pretty good, idk why everyone is complaining"
1,"That's why San Diegians did not want to approve a new stadium on the ballot, just a waste of a new stadium good riddance"
1,"Call me sexist if you want, but football doesn't sound right with a female commentator."
1,What's you're guys favorite NFL team? Mines the cowboys and ravens.
1,"I'm all for equality but I didn't like the fact that a women was commentating pretty much the whole game, it kind of ruined it."
1,The ref falling at the top of the screen at 1:43 😂😂
1,The ref really falls though 🤣 1:43
1,Afc west is afc best.
1,The girl did just fine y'all are dicks.
1,Denver has a good QB idk why people are tripping bout him.......
1,"You may think that the chargers lost...\n\n\n\n\nBut they didn't get injured, so thats a win in my book."
1,How the anoucer pronounces some things is kind of irritating
1,denver qb has a strong arm
1,New color commentators...\n\nRomo: 10/10\nRyan: Boring/10
1,lol most accurate kicker in denver history and misses...  sportscaster jinxed it..
1,The ref falls at 1:45 lmao
1,Did someone notice the referee on the uper side of the field? 1:37 :D
1,The commentator an 11 year old boy?
1,yo watch the top of screen at 1:43 ref busts his ass lol
1,"Siemian looks way better than he was last year, if our O Line can improve, we can definitely make the playoffs or who knows, maybe even the Super Bowl"
1,Anyone else see the ref fall at 1:42 lmao
1,Gordon is doing the badgers proud
1,"Half the comments are about the commentator. She is is being criticized far more than any other male commentators. People saying how she doesn't have a voice for tv, doesn't have a passion for football. Smh. Sexist people will find any reason to hold women back especially when they break into something as male dominated as football commentating."
1,Ash ketchum finally grew up and got a real job. Give up on your dreams
1,Greatest charger comeback in nfl history thumbs up if you agree GO Bolts

Label,Comment
-1,You and your shit brother may have single handedly ruined YouTube.....thanks...
-1,Honestly Evan is so annoying. Like its not funny watching him try to be famous he's trying way to hard and I don't like it
-1,"Ayyyyoooo Logang what up .  This was a hard vlog to watch Logan how dare are you to destroyed that YouTube bag . Logang Army check my covers and share them  can Logang help me to hit 1,000 Subscribers today, I think we can do it SUBSCRIBE"
-1,Made a lot of people hate youtube - GJ
-1,Evan is a horrible human being he also looks so jealous when you open it like he should be happy for you
-1,Gotta love Youtube for giving morons the ability to earn a buck from other morons.
-1,Can the Pauls please stop saying they're the fastest growing YouTube channels?! That's PewDiePie's position!! He made managed to get all the subscribers you guys have in 6 MONTHS!!! Why is that so hard to understand?!
-1,Not a hater but fuck you
-1,Where is the other dog
-1,I go out of my way to dislike every single one your videos
-1,He talking about how we changed logging Forever on his own channel should be a lot more humbling if somebody else made this video instead of you know Logan Paul make it a video about how Logan Paul change login forever you didn't change shit if anything you just exposed a large audience of five to 10 year olds maybe even freshman in high school that like your videos people that you can hook up with or fuck really sad and it's really pathetic how your entire audience is made up of these people nobody can actually buy or afford anything without asking their parents that's exactly who your audience is
-1,FUCK THIS DUDE AND HIS BROTHER.
-1,"Evan is just taking ur money for granted cause he said if his Rolex had fake diamonds he wouldn't be ur friend anymore and he left when u said the diamond was real, but don't keep commenting it's probably a joke cause ik it might be but my opinion is that he's using Logan's money for granted"
-1,tone it down fgt you didn't change youtube
-1,it's everyday bro
-1,This is shit.
-1,"#1 on trending, FUCK YES!"
-1,You're telling me that you're not perfect and sometimes you fuck up? \nThat's wired..
-1,"dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah"
-1,this isn't a bad thing... shit happens
-1,"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist."
-1,pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.
-1,I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well
-1,"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!"
-1,People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it
-1,To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD
-1,If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period
-1,I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill.
-1,Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao
-1,"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)"
-1,Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down 😂😂 btw I do like idubbz it was just an example
-1,"If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video."
-1,"Weird, my thumbs up doesn't stay. Could it be corrupted YouTube again?"
-1,"The day nobody cares about the word is the day it loses its power over people. Don't try to tell me that I'm only saying this because I don't UNDERSTAND. I DO. People have been slaughtered before, Countries have been Defiled AND ENSLAVED.. USED AS PROSTITUTES. NOT ONLY YOU... WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THIS N WORD STILL ENSLAVE YOU?"
-1,Who gives a Shit .
-1,say the word cracker.. journos wont care because theres a huge double standard and they hate white people!
-1,"I think it is okay, you are sorry about that and it is done. Strange is, that we have here 2 kind of people. 1 which can say this word with N and nothing happen und the other people where everybody get insane. Just think of it."
-1,Real life racism in the world<Guy says dum shit on a video game..
-1,People in the coments you are stupid hes an adult its not a mastake he should know not to say it stop defending him all the time
-1,Y'all are stupid
-1,I bet you only 10% of the people getting triggered by him saying the n word are actually black.
-1,Hey Felix who care? The context is what matters. We know you are not a racist. Don't feed into these stupid narratives.
-1,Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf
-1,"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell."
-1,Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it.
-1,"You are basically the face of YouTube. For someone who has woken up from a coma since before YouTube was around you'd be the first thing they'd know about YouTube. I know you have all this pressure under your shoulders because if you say anything wrong, it would be like the YouTube logo walked on stage and said: Fuck off! \n\nIt's hard to control how you are and speak, I know it, and I feel bad for you. You didn't have to apologize, as you said nigger to a yellow fucking blob, but you did."
-1,If a black american says the n word it's called slang. If a black american can call us white people or typical white girls it's called fun. But if a white person says the n word he's a racist. K den
-1,Fuck niggers.
-1,Fucking nigger
-1,What if I wanna unlock my phone while in the bed in the dark
-1,I'm just not impressed
-1,Looks outdated with the chrome.
-1,Let time and technology turned iPhone X cheaper. For now I'll settle down with my secondhanded 6s. I have skipped 7 anyway and definitely won't buy 8.
-1,What if it's to dark to recognise youre face how do you unlock it?
-1,It's apple so all of my friends probably automatically hate it
-1,I don’t really like the no home button :(( I like Touch ID more then this face id
-1,"If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly. Poor iPhone 9 and 7 doesn't get an s model. Next year, remove the numerics and refer to it only as iPhone the same way the numerics no longer exist for iPads or a MacBook."
-1,The back is ugly
-1,"Face recognition is the most stupid thing ever imo. I can get into my S5 just as fast, and with way more simplicity with my pattern lock. And is it just me or does that look like a past display screen, it's the complete opposite of an infinity screen and looks ugly."
-1,"The phone looks cool on the front but the back and sides look awful, especially with that glass back and how the camera lip is like the Iphone 6 (Not smooth) and not like the Iphone 7 (smooth)."
-1,Android has done this already not original
-1,Apple disabled the comments... Cowards
-1,wtf 1000$ welp aint gettin this anytime soon im not rich
-1,Did you mean: Samsung Galaxy S8
-1,Wtf happened to the iPhone 9?
-1,Waste of money...
-1,Most disappointing Apple event ever
-1,Apple went full retard
-1,idiot
-1,Apple: The Emoji Machine now with fidget spinner emojis  (whispering) we being payed by Sony to advertise the fidget spinners movie (whispering)\nBy the way you forgot to include you can buy  at least 20 SNES minis.
-1,This video reminds me of my sister because I think of her in penguin costumes & clumsy. & She said similar things back in the day like with that webpage.
-1,I hope apple loses money cause after the iPhone 6'its all been shit
-1,I honestly thought I was the only one and that was like are they serious it's official people only buy iPhones for the name iPhone because they don't have anything to offer it's nothing it's full of crap what I don't understand what the hell is that
-1,Who the fuck pays $1000 for an iPhone?
-1,No more using your phone while charging
-1,So thanks apple now I'm confused did they just release the IPhone 8 and 10 at the same time making one obsolete also what's with these software companies and they're hatred of the number 9?!?
-1,Gaming pc that allows me to play games in 4k...or phone that allows me to watch games in 4k with a black bar...such a hard decision
-1,man i wants this phone so bad but i can't afford it 😂😂

-1,You poor hippocrats..Still crying and looking for attention.
-1,Ben Carson's stupidity still hasn't failed to shock me.
-1,BEN CARSON IS THE MAN!!!!! THEY HATE HIM CAUSE HE EXPOSED HITLARY'S RITUAL ABUSE ON CHILDREN!!!!!!!
-1,DON'T TAKE ME TO A BLACK DOCTOR
-1,"Sad part he's not the only one not qualified for his post. We have a guy who sued EPA a number of times as the EPA chief. Devos as Education Chief, Rick Perry as Energy secretary, and a racist midget is the AG."
-1,"After seen this clip I'm flabbergasted, in my stupidity I'd thought that in the presidential cabinet it had only one crazy person but I see that they have a collection of them."
-1,Ben Carson - someone dumber and stranger than Donald - hard to believe
-1,Ben carson on paper looked like a put together fella. Then he started talking on tv. Now we all know there is something terribly wrong with HIS BRAIN.
-1,I hope Louis Black is watching this.
-1,Ben Carson is proof that a person can be a neurosurgeon and somehow still be stupid as hell.
-1,I have a question. Where's the... luggage! Someone took his luggage :(. Ahhhhhhh
-1,"2:34 Watching that guy in the background as his eyes bounce back and forth rapidfire between Warren and Carson.\n\n5:55 Seriously, he probably fell asleep"
-1,Ben Carson is a idiot. But what else is to expect from a American?
-1,"Does he only operate on foreign children, or is he just taking a break from helping? I guess we shouldn't get on Carson too much for his worst answer to a marathon Q&A, but jeez this guy."
-1,Well… The brain surgeon Ben Carson just proved how truly insane he is…
-1,Rural Americans black people only voted for Obama because he's blackBen Carson runs for president Black people: NO!Rural Americans: but we thought.......

-1,Just here for the thumbs down! **liberal propaganda**
-1,Merica is seriously in chaos
-1,Facial recognition! No way! Oh wait my damn Nexus 4 had that shit. God apple is so pathetic these days
-1,Am I the only person who finds the shape of the screen unappealing? It looks like the screen has ears.
-1,stupid face id. so what is you are a twin. should have stuck with touch id for security
-1,"Here's a question: if you trigger Siri by holding down the Sleep/Wake button, how do you turn off the phone?"
-1,And no 128gb. 64gb and then 256. Ridiculous. Anyway... not upgrading.
-1,The battery icon already changes from white to black . It's stock iOS . Tell me something new .
-1,Specs are fine but imo..... Hate the design for the hell of everything!
-1,$1000 for a phone?!?! WTF. then iPhone XI will come out in six months but this time it will be larger. geez
-1,"I don't get it. Since it has 3D Touch, why didn't Apple incorporate a hard press at the bottom of the screen to go home? Swipe seems less intuitive."
-1,Literally looks like a bad version of the s8 mixed in with some bad Chinese Android knockoffs.
-1,"Eehhhhhhh, its a disappointment. The s8 and note 8 are miles ahead."
-1,"Really ? You don't have any complaints right off the bat? That's kinda sad, I saw you as a reliable source of information."
-1,I was really curious about that iPhone 9 thing too. Apparently it's the iPhone X because it's the ten year anniversary
-1,*Does anyone thinks this is a complete waste of money?*
-1,There are some A holes that judging something they can’t afford stupid kids down there
-1,How do you turn the phone off if holding down the button activates Siri?
-1,"If you forget the gimmicky bezeless front, the iPhone X is lowkey trash"
-1,Yay! Another stupidly overpriced iPhone!

1,Okay seriously people? All the hate just because she has a different job. I'm a legitimate physicist (Doing my masters so that counts right? :D ) and I don't think it is necessary to belittle her for doing something that is physically impressive. She made that look real and I for one know I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
1,"wow, such talent. What a pro. She walked like she had been doing it most of her life."
1,Wow this is the dumbest profession I've ever seen.

Why y'all stuck in the field YOU CHOSE ? fuck all ya guys gotta blame yourselves for making the decision you made instead of being salty because of someone else's success and wealth from a different industry. Lmfao.

1,Would've been better if she lost that outfit
1,What until she gets older her back is going to be torn up.
1,What am I more upset about? The fact that this is on trending or the fact that I actually watched it?
1,"Lol check out my Jake Paul Diss Track. Leave some love or hate, appreciate both! ✌"
1,Wow all these jellys in the comments section. Go get some help people and try to focus on your life more.

-1,@28:55 the epitome of decadence and creepiness. These people are out of touch creepozoids! Just look into their eyes.... they do not give a shit... they would kill you and eat you for dinner just to be trendy in a second. They disgust me... anything they do disgusts me. Using this tragedy orchestrated and allowed by the government in order to punish Trump and spew race based GARBAGE and get off on themselves as if they are actually DOING someting>>>> they make me want to VOMIT RIGHT IN THEIR FACES! They are not taking calls on those phones... its all fake its all phony! We are on to your sick mind games.
-1,All the celebrities should join together and help the hurricane tragic damages. The people have supported and help them become famous they need to put their money where their mouth is. The people don't want to see or hear stupid ass shows. This show probably took a lot of money to set up the funds should go to Houston.
-1,Do not ever give money to events like this!! Very little money if any goes to the victims
-1,If you live in a hurricane zone and don't have insurance.......you're a fucking retard.   Do you expect the rest of the country to bail you out ever 3-5 years?   Florida Hurricane Welfare System

If you think your so smart then think about this, this is one guy who is trying to entertain you while being pressured by the millions of people to trick them. It's him vs all of the viewers and anybody with half a brain knows every trick has a reveal but that does not make it bad. Also no your 6 year old son did not solve the trick because you are most likely too young to have one."

-1,"That juice is really the salt water that gets injected into the dead bird you're about to eat. The bird was also fed arsenic and makes your cancer risk go up from what your risk would be just from the animal protein, which all turns on igf-1 in your body causing all cancer cells to grow. Then there's the heart disease risk, as chicken has almost the same amount of cholesterol and saturated fat as beef."

-1,Now this is the shit!
-1,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that."

-1,"Ah ah ah Take that all those but beauty is in the eye of the beholder it's the inner beauty that matters people. \n\nWe've been so much brainwashed by Hollywood beauty standards casting good looking people with zero talent who are not cinvincing on screen anyway because we can't relate to them. \nEven blind persons can see that looks matter way too much in this shallow world, and some of us have zero chance to make it and will always be disadvantaged in dating, job opportunities, social interactions, etc.\n\nI'm off to the gym to be less ugly then."
-1,"Preference = Shallowness ,   why can't we just like and dislike without being considered shallow, its just a preference , I personally like big butts that cannot deny.....  "
-1,ask blind men how they find the pussy
-1,I'm listening to Korn as I watch this.....I CAN SEE I CAN SEE I CAN SEE I'M GOING BLIND
-1,the only ones privileged not to see how ugly people & the human condition really are.
-1,Everyone so shocked that these people can be shallow they're human like just because they're blind they're not going to be looks don't matter like the fuc they're human they're going to act like human just because they can't see doesn't mean they're going to change y'all dumb as fuck
-1,I am thin............. WHAT
-1,Omg dude in green shirt looks dead on that guy that makes fun of people who wears goth sht forget his name some u tuber
-1,This is how i loose 10 kg in 15 days. This method truly works https://goo.gl/JEemx6
-1,the blind people in this video are all prettier than me.  tfw...
-1,"the blind guy saying blind people can be shallow, bruh that's not good, also the other one who said I'm thin and i have nice hair !!WTF just being thin isn't attractive it's athletic and nice hair isn't straight and silky it could be curly"
-1,I always have a question in my head...\nDo blind people see in their dreams?
-1,The girl in blue just seems like she's trying to be like everyone else.....pretttyyyy lame.
-1,If someone is born blind how will they know how people or humans in general look like..
-1,"Damn I just thought about this, blind people can't watch porn. I don't know what I'd do with all that extra time. 😂😂"
-1,"I didn´t think they would just be focusing in physical beauty, but damn boy are they Shallow"
-1,I FUCKING ADORE MAC HE IS SO CUTE WTF
-1,People in the comment section seriously just make me sick
-1,"I learned that blind people have huge egos unless you are black, that dude didnt have an ego"
-1,I've been really trying not to say nothing but why the black dude glasses not on his ears?\n\n\n\n\n\n Like they so tight on his head that it doesn't need to be held up like that....ok I'ma stop talking.
-1,Let me be the first to say these blind people are ugly as fuck
-1,Wow the blind chick wasn't lying when she said she was a shallow fuck
-1,The shallow girl is not pretty enough to be shallow. No wonder she is single
-1,The black guy be like I might be blind but at least I ain't black\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssa joke
-1,"Blind, deaf, etc. We're still all PEOPLE!"
-1,Hi my name is Jason and I'm blind because I have something in my eye and it's annoying
-1,Alas our society is super vain when we're literally asking blind people how they know if someone is hot looking!
-1,I don't care I hope others don't this is dumb it's saying see blind people have standards fucking everyone does bitch everyone
-1,I cant fucking imagine not seeing EVER i really feel bad for her
-1,This makes me so sad. I can't wait for the day when technology progresses enough that it allows these people to see.
-1,What I learned... Blind people are shitty just like regular people ohhh big shock.
-1,So beauty is skin deep and determined by the feeling of their hair and the shape and size of their body even to blind people got it
-1,Yeah this video sucks
-1,I would totally date the blind girl!
-1,Anybody calling these blind people shallow need to rethink themselves. There always need to be some level of physical attractieness in a relationship. I find someone being shallow if they only like a person for only one aspect of them and nothing else. And theres nothing wrong with liking thin people. Ever heard of preferences?
-1,This video was so pathetic to say the least!!!
-1,"I LOVE THE GIRL IN BLUE KEEPING IT REAL! YASS! To everyone crying about how this was disappointing because it wasn't disability inspiration porn enough for them, sorry to burst your bubble, but people with disabilities are just that... people. At the end of the day they are just as shallow as you or me and 98% of the rest of the population. Don't cry because they are being honest, be grateful they aren't lying out their ass like people usually seem so inclined to do these days."
-1,Just sad how shallow the world is... smh it even affects people who cant see it
-1,"An unending stream of consciousness with no rational point, no rational anything, and absolutely no self awareness."
-1,Hillary is just a typical feminist. She doesn't want to accept responsibility and she thinks she's entitled to everything just because she's a woman. People just didn't want her and the age of feminism is over.
-1,"If you want to know what Hillary Clinton really thinks, you can't ask her in person. Everything she says is a lie. This interview is pointless fluff."
-1,People forget one little MAJOR thing. The Democrats are the ones who wanted slavery. They were the party of the kkk. They were the Confederates.
-1,anyone regretting not supporting Bernie or Johnson now?
-1,I couldn't vote for her or Trump. It sucks having a conscience AND reasoning skills....
-1,Why is media even covering this disgusting woman anymore?
-1,Who cares what that idiot thinks
-1,"She says the right is anti-immigrant. Lies, we are anti ILLEGAL immigrant. People are dumb to buy her book. she's already a multi millionaire. Want to make millions, became an identity politics politician."
-1,Trump sucks .. ha ha you think Hillary is any better you moron! Hillary sucks .. ha ha you think Trump is any better you moron!
-1,"Haha the failure wrote a book solely blaming other people for her losing: Bernie Sanders, James Comey, etc"
-1,"Giving Hillary airtime and mindshare instead of Bernie, when the former is busy profiting from book sales and interviews and the latter is attempting to introduce Universal Health Care and actively fighting Trump. smdh"
-1,"Hate her all you want guys, but you have to admit, wouldn't it be nice to have a president who's actually informed and can converse intelligently on actual issues?"
-1,I still don't understand how people POSSIBLY think she's worse than Trump.
-1,Thank God we did not elect this witch.
-1,You know you're a fail when you lose to a commie and trump #maga
-1,"You can tell Ezra Klein has a past in sports, when he asks softball questions like this"
-1,the only thing Hillary did wrong was be too polite
-1,"Number one on the agenda, for both the Democratic and Republican parties, should be to slow down the death-spiral of rising healthcare costs.\n\nNo plan, not Obamacare nor a Trumpcare plan will ever be feasible if these prices outpace GDP growth."
-1,I gave the Clinton Foundation a million dollars and all I got for it was her book. I hate it when I don't get the correct change back.
-1,**Vox is Liberal Propaganda** HILLARY FOR PRISON! 1 LIKE ON THIS COMMENT EQUALS 1 VOTE FOR HER TO GO TO PRISON!!
-1,"Pathetic piece by loser Ezra. She's a corrupt corporate Democrat willing to trample on progressives to further her right-wing agenda. She's pro-war, oil, and pharma. What's the point of this interview? She's already pointed the finger at everyone else for her embarrassing loss. Stop giving her airtime and Ezra- grow a pair and stop being a wide eyed fanboy"
-1,“Disliked Hillary”
-1,Wtf is wrong with the men of today. 🙄
-1,Black sea Click my YouTube Name and watch my YouTube Channel how robot augmented Boko Haram Freaks and Hamburg cell Germany blocked me 30 years to learn a profession and tortured. We want our HUMAN rights GG12 UN23
-1,This is Weird but is Understandable people. Thanks.
-1,Of course the Father In-law is bad ass. Look at his chest hairs! Dead give away.
-1,How is this trending ? Awful
-1,Fear :small hole?
-1,Isn't that scary
-1,Kweeva seems so rude omg
-1,5:37 - 5:40 dead meme
-1,If it wasnt already broken you definitely would have broken it 😂😂
-1,You could have just called the phone to find it you know.... Use your other sinces you weren't born with only eyes
-1,It may not look that bad in Florida but the Caribbean islands are the ones that got hit the most
-1,"I am so sick of people saying not that bad,not everyone is rich or can afford to rebuild."
-1,"It wasn't that bad in parts of Florida ,but it hit the Carribean horribly"
-1,a horrible attempt to try and get us to freak out
-1,"You know, spotlight should be shown where the hurricane was actually catastrophic: down in the Island Nations. Place where there is no more infrastructure anymore. Where people can't find food anymore because of the hurricane. Not where someone's boat is half sunken or a roof was torn off and that's it."
-1,So some trailers were missing some roofs and that's it? Wheres the flattened buildings or flooded city streets?
-1,Why are they only showing mobile homes?\nAren't they less likely to go through a big storm like this?
-1,This isn’t bad at all... if you wanna see bad then look at the Caribbean islands where it looks like Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.
-1,From the air USA Today posts fake news.
-1,It's not that bad
-1,"Lool. If you call this bad then that's nothing. Seriously these look right next to the ocean too. Trailer park looked decent. Did you plan the before and after, common? You can't call this catastrophic"
-1,*BUT DID IT DESTROY A GAMING CHAIR*
-1,this is one of the worst videos I've ever seen
-1,Lol!!! A few cardboard box houses were blown away.... devastating
-1,"First off. This was sad in comparison to Andrew. Second, WHO FILMS DRONE SHOTS IN 1x1?! It looks terrible."
-1,Catastrophic? Sit down.
-1,Remember to pay your climate change dues so this shit won't happen anymore.
-1,bahahaha what's with all that saturation with before irma show us the real pics and don't make it too exaggerated yeesh
-1,Its nit that bad from what i see
-1,It was a CAT 3 at landfall and quickly weakened soon after made worse only by the fact that many a moron live in aluminum boxes. Are those things even anchored beyond electric & gas connectors?
-1,Looks like a trailer park in texas after a small tornado.
-1,Had to stop it 5 seconds in because of the music. Fail
-1,OH MY GOD!!! THE WORST STORM EVER SLIGHTLY DAMAGED SOME PROPERTIES! CALL FEMA! \n\nWhat is Florida's death toll again?
-1,It really wasn't as bad as it could be.
-1,Irma kicked the shit out of those trailer parks.
-1,Lmfao people are disappointed that is wasn't worse wtf is wrong with you people
-1,"Trump is in trouble, he has to donate 2 million dollars now. He's going to be broke"
-1,Whats with the horrible music? tf
-1,"Other then some property damage and laying tress, irma did nothing"
-1,👍 Thumbs up if you were expecting a creepy clown with this music.   🤡
-1,Building codes in Florida should make structure more wind resistant. But to me it looks corners were cute. And i cant feel sorry for people live in mobil homes next to the shore in hurricane alley (Florida). Thats just stupid.
-1,"Houston got it bad, Florida came out not that bad"
-1,THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.  COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.
-1,They hyped this storm up to be absolutely devastating when it hit Florida but it was no where near that...smh
-1,"I like how they're only covering Florida but not the Carribean that got fucked by the strongest hurricane to be ever formed in the Atlantic at its strongest point (190 MPH Winds and 225 MPH Gusts) that even caused places like Barbuda to be Inhabitable (meaning you're not allowed to live there anymore) which the entirety of that island got 95-100% destroyed. And the dozens that also died throughout there. They didn't even cover Puerto Rico, which the US owns. Like shit..."
-1,Irma wasn't that bad..
-1,Quit overhyping it. Andrew was worse.
-1,Harvey was 10 times worse
-1,My room looks worse
-1,Follow my Vlog bad boy
-1,FAKE NEWS!!
-1,This'll prove the Irma deniers wrong
-1,"What the f ever, Harvey caused way worse deatruction... florida lost sum shingles and couple boats so fuckin what"
-1,So a few shingles missing is devistation?  Then Harvey must have been apocoltptic.
-1,Your face looks fake.
-1,Liiivvvinnnngggg for that dark lip!!!
-1,"Girl, don't leave me hangin. What was the fail foundation?"
-1,your lips look like they deflated a little bit and it looks really natural and flattering to the proportions of your face 😍
-1,"Yaay, fall makeup! 😍 It's so cold here that I already forgot about summer!"
-1,Airbrushing -> Unnatural beauty standards -> Social pressures -> Expectations of excessive makeup -> Youtube makeup tutorials -> Ubiquity of excessive makeup -> Ubiquity of skin problems -> Rampant disease -> Zombie apocalypse -> End of human race as we know it
-1,75K??? ill do it for 5k
-1,Poor Liam.  Lets hope he never gets on the same bus with Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves.
-1,Looks like the guy from Non Stop got cleaned up and had a couple of kids and then....got himself in to some similar mess. Liam Neeson just can't catch a break...
-1,"Couldn't happen in the UK. If you tried to start a conversation with a stranger, they'd look at you like you're insane and slowly edge away."
-1,About bloody time. I've been waiting for this trailer since the movie was announced nearly a year ago.
-1,WOAH WOAH.....Tommen? In modern? I'm probably on that weird side of youtube again?
-1,"I'm moving seats, don't speak crazy"
-1,Geez how long is his commute??
-1,You can't go wrong with Liam Neeson.
-1,Norma isnt dead!!!! L
-1,"Thought it said computer also, why didn't that chick get more naked in The Departed :("
-1,415 people are unable to accept the truth of their reality.
-1,You're pathetic if u can't go a few days w/o a phone
-1,"You say that like it's a bad thing... \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!"
-1,I stay on my phone when I'm bored then they mobile is invented to make me unbored in home if that's a word 😂
-1,problem isn't with phones but with ourselves. \nlike hello....move your ass a little around!!
-1,"We spend too much time with our phones, why we should talk to other people in real life, if we could spent our whole life to stare on our phone? (I'm guilty too in this case, so please don't judge me!) ^^"
-1,"My break from my phone is photography... granted, I listen to music via my phone, but at least I'm not still staring at it... and fuck off if you say my cameras a screen, I spend much more time looking around and through the view finder than at the screen"
-1,why did this video take such a dark turn... didnt expect a video about phones to be so morbid
-1,"I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple.."
-1,1:10 - Scary how this described my current problem at the moment.
-1,"I'm having a hard time putting my finger on this one but something about the videos produced by these guys rubs me the wrong but I can not seem to articulate it.  But, I am getting the sense that I'm being preached to and I feel that many of the ideas that are being asserted should be debated.  Perhaps that is the point of the videos.....  at least I hope that is."
-1,I don't see anything wrong with that. And I watching this video with my phone. Knowledge is the biggest enemy of the scammers
-1,"I do not own a phone. I was asked what the time was once, by this human girl person, and I said; I don't know, because I didn't know. The human girl person asked me if I didn't have a phone on me. I said no, because I didn't. She glared at me like I was personally insulting her by trying to fool her into thinking I had no phone.\n But yeah, I guess I can understand her mistrust...everyone nowadays has a phone..."
-1,"I have my phone on me but rarely get a call. Or text. Somewhat feel I need it on me but on occasions I leave behind.  I want technology to aid my life, get something from it rather than pointless time wasting."
-1,"Listen to Arcade Fire's Everything Now album. We're addicted to this instant gratification our phones provide us. The more readily available something is, the less we value it. It's a dangerous game, and I think people need to wake up soon."
-1,This guy's voice haha what the fuck
-1,"I like the critique of smart-phones, but found this imagined future technology worse. Let's admit now what the ancient Greeks knew and told in their myths (and here we can include too the ancient Indians, Chinese and Japanese who knew and told likewise): often technologies and machines are just bad."
-1,"If I were you I'd change my phone, because I live in Lima, Perú and you got the population wrong"
-1,"In the Utopia - and that's when I checked out.\nWhat's more likely to happen?  Maybe a big tech corporatocracy.  Maybe a singularity gone horribly wrong.  Maybe a cyber cold war not just between opposing nations but between security and privacy.  Maybe, if George Carlin is right, the planet will shake us off like fleas.  But no matter how smart technology gets, it will only ever be a tool, not a guardian angel."
-1,Who else doesn't give 1 shit
-1,Lel I use my phone cuz I'm bored
-1,Delete them unnecessary applications 😎
-1,Eat shit!
-1,fuck yo capitalism
-1,Ya I don't think phones r that big of a deal. I don't use my phone for all that shit.
-1,"0:30  Yoooooo Fuck this shit. Please! Please. Don't think this is your own self. Sitting in a room letting your thoughts flow to simultaneously the past and future, feeling at the same time pain, desire, regret and excitement all at the same time. The Mean is to be in a room just watching. Being in the moment not pretending your in the past or future. I mean why were those emotions chosen? every emotion is surely a part of life but thoughts of desire, pain and regret do not seem great to me. It's videos like this that let me know some part of the world wants to lead somewhere sad."
-1,You humans are fucking dumb
-1,I have watched this a billion times today..I was late to work slightly cause of this and here I am still squealing over them...hot damn LANY are high-key hot 😭💖
-1,I'm obsessed with this song😍💓❤
-1,I'm still waiting for pink skies mv. Pleaseeeeeeeee
-1,Why did they have to schedule their concert the same day as John Bellion :((
-1,She is the worst.
-1,So sad to see James to sell out. And for what?
-1,Fuck goop and her big bird looking ass.
-1,Fuck Gwyneth. She's a fraud.
-1,There are some truth to her methods like cupping and steam. When we are sick we turn on the shower and we use steam. but stones curing you is NOT TRUE. Smelling stuff won't cure fertility. AND she is probably overpricing these methods.
-1,All I know is...gwenyth is fucking fire in that dress...reminds me of being young and dating an aspiring mode...going to work in the daytime then getting off and driving an hour to see her and she'd be wearing some shit like that...makes me wanna use my dick as a knife and stab through that stupid dress and nail her muscular ass so hard she gets whiplash....fucking hot ass bitch...she needs it...I need it..I'm a man...she's goddamn hot...i dont care if it's that dress or not she's gonna get something so hard and long over and over the dmv is gonna shut down cause it feels dumb....have you ever seen two feet spread so far apart you think they might not be attached to a human body? Well you're gonna when I crack them puppies wide and start laying into that vag like its zaxbys special sauce..dipping and dippin then drinking it in....then I'm gonna order some more when I say..UNh uh....don't you even think about flipping over! But that's not gonna happen...her eyes are gonna be rolled back in her head so far she'll be seeing the northern lights as I stroke and stroke and stroke and stroke until my legs give out and I collapse onto the floor and cry like a baby begging for her to get up and climb down off the chair and ride me like evel kenevil flying over some cars until she crashes into the pile of me below...sweat pouring off her sharp chin...hair falling around my face....i drink her sweat and run my hands up her hard abs as she's bending and crushing my tower like penis on her every stroke like she's some kind of shined hillbilly playing a saw at the county fair..I feel it bend and spring out inside her actually hitting her uterus as she stretches upward moaning the hot sweat of the night air and open windows rolling on her body filling my belly button like I've spilled my silky seed on it...as she climaxes she starts speaking in some foreign language which I later find out is the mental limit between the physical and the ethereal and she explodes in orgasm so hard she turns in to a mid air splash of pure Florida orange juice and I'm left lying in my tight blue Levi's with no shirt on in my trailer and I wake up and realize I'm just drunk and hallucinating but there is orange juice everywhere....and maybe she was there...and maybe she wasn't....but I'm thankful for my vintage heather blue Levi's orange tab boot cut vintage jeans...if I hadn't had them on with a thick leather belt...I might've put a hole in my trailer wall....all I'm saying...is that gwenyth Paltrow....in this one second I'm seeing you...you make me wanna tear you apart...I'm not saying you're beautiful or ugly or pretty or nice...I don't know what it is...but...you got what this man needs....that's all I'm saying. (Not to blow you up but...hey Margo stilley! Remember that night you came down? Yeah well I had to insert gwenyth Paltrow into it because she's fucking exploder right here...I know you were the one in the dress when I met you and it was silver not gold and you're not gwenyth Paltrow but...if I could get a hold of gwenyth Paltrow right now...well..I damn sure wouldn't be saying hi to you...you snotty evasive tart...)
-1,"This goop crap should be illegal. And, shame on Gwyneth for using her celebrity status to promote such ridiculous pseudoscience."
-1,Goop = poop !!! why do people even buy that shit !! XD
-1,Don't care for whatever stupid reason Paltrow's getting all this hate. You've gotta admit she's got KILLER legs 😛❤️
-1,Isn't she the one that has questionable life hacks?
-1,Vaginal steaming actually seems like... really fucking dangerous tbh. I wonder how much she paid the show to promote her shitty overpriced lifestyle magazine
-1,What the fuck James? What the fuck...
-1,there is a difference between scripted content and fucking unfunny ones...
-1,Is it just me or does that dress look like a half popped Jiffy Pop?
-1,goop... it's way too expensive to be worth it.
-1,"wow i can't believe you just dedicated a segment for this scam, tricking desperate people in need of medical treatment out of their money with bogus science is a despicable act and i'm disappointed that one of my favorite talk shows is endorsing this pseudoscience  bullshit, shame on u james..."
-1,Isn't this the same woman that suggested sticking a jade egg up your vagina? Fuck this absurd shit.
-1,Gwyneth needs to be smacked upside the head for pushing her crap on everyone.
-1,"This skit would if been funnier if he said the classic She's behind me, isn't she?."
-1,So annoying when they all screamed. It ruins everything.
-1,*despise this entitled dumb ass bitch*
-1,Stop promoting idiocy!
-1,Paltrow is not my type at all but damn i'd love to get to know her naughty side.  I bet she is into some really fucked up shit.:shudders:
-1,"shes ugly slut\n\ndress like a whore, mimiks like a whore...buh...actor allways as a whore"
-1,Fuck that scam bitch
-1,"James,  you should seek medical treatment if your shit is grey mate"
-1,I'm surprised she didn't try to sell him some of her fake healing crystals
-1,"Fuck goop, but Gwyneth can still get it"
-1,Boring
-1,Fuck Goop. It's pseudo-scientific bullshit.
-1,WHAT DOES THIS DISEASED COCKSUCKING FUDGEPACKER KNOW? SOMEBODY SEW THAT BLOODY PROLAPSED ASSHOLE OF HIS SHUT.
-1,"Fuck Goop and their pseudoscience bullshit. The one people dumb enough to believe that shit are anti-vaccers, flat Earthers, moon landing deniers, climate change deniers... Basically crackpots wearing tinfoil hats."
-1,"Have you noticed that Paltrow has trouble containing her hatred of Germans? She even referred to her German grandmother (from whom she gets he beauty, I suspect) as a cunt. Paltrow is a hate-filled woman and a Hollywood phony. 😉"
-1,I have been on acutaine for a few months now and I went from having extremely oily skin with cystic acne to a few regular blemishes here and there (still not done with taking the pills) but my face is so dry now! I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though!
-1,"Curious, but does make up make ppl break out easier?"
-1,"Your trending girl! Thats pretty awsome, also thanks for trying out another foundation instead of making this a short fail vid. Your hard work is def. Appreciated and acknowledged!!"
-1,Your skin looks bad. I would NOT put ANYTHING on it. Eat pineapple and get some SUN! It will help kill the the acne causing bacteria and smooth your skin out. Fresh cut pineapple every other day for two weeks. And no makeup for two weeks.\n\nStart with that and you will need a lot less foundation!!
-1,That's so weird (the Lottie foundation) cause I have both of there's. The stick foundation is one of my favourite foundations plus it covers a lot! \n\nThough I do have fairly unblemished skin.
-1,is it sad I won't watch anyone else's review on the fenty foundation until I see Taylor's on day 13 cause her opinion's the only one I really care about😂
-1,I'm kind of disappointed that I can't get a #15daysof foundation shirrrrrrt but at the same time I understand she's doing something biggggg
-1,"If your natural hair is blond, why do your eyebrows grow in black?"
-1,ALL THESE FUCKIN RETARDED MAKEUP TUTORIAL YOUTUBERS NEED  TO EITHER DIE OR GET OFF THE MOTHERFUCKING TRENDING FEED.

-1,Kristen Bell is a sweetie but also slightly crossed-eyed.
-1,wrong really please  this look viopently  overlook
-1,Seth Rogen and Kristen Bell were in Orlando but I couldn't go see them because I was stuck inside from the hurricane :(
-1,"How about you Americans stop wasting 54% of your taxes on military and the weapon industry and creating a proper infrastructure (including a flood relief structure (Romans had an underground sewer system which protected them from floods and is still intact...and over 2000 years old), a flood and other natural disasters counter force instead of military. Such a shame that you are antiSemitic and didn't vote for Sanders. And: you have to create a 24/7 citizen surveillance against all members of the House and Senate."
-1,boring
-1,She aint bad 👍 👌
-1,**Jimmy Kimmel is liberal propaganda**
-1,Sometimes I think YouTube should get rid of the dislike button...\n...I'm guessing that at least 107 people thus far would give me a thumbs down for saying that.
-1,Literally am overwhelmed with the support you have from your family . You have over these past few months proved to me that it doesnt matter what or who you are you can achieve anything i have a baby in hospital he had been there a year and i want him to achieve anything he wants with support from family you have proved anything is possible
-1,"8:03 is crazy!! The turn, i didnt even realize.. Nice!"

-1,Do an all pink nicki minaj pink print cupcake!!
-1,Pls make star vs the forces of evil cookies or cake😛Pls...
-1,"Can you please bake things that aren't various types of poop and personal branding? I would never make a cupcake, or a cookie, or macarons, or a giant cookie cake, just because your nerdy (read: smiley face with glasses) logo is on it. And why would I seek out your recipes if I'm just going to end up turning them into regular old cupcakes or cookies because I don't want to bake your logo into a dessert? I used to look forward to your videos but am really disappointed with the quality lately. You used to be so much better than this. :("
-1,I'm hungry now :(
-1,"Ro, I really love your channel and I have been subscribed for a long time, but recently, I have been very disappointed that your last few videos have been only in order to promote your baking line. I understand that you need to promote it and it is really, really good but i feel that it is now repetitive. I dont mind if you do it once every few videos or something like that, but as a loyal subscriber i just wanted to let you know that i was disappointed. Nevertheless, i am still subscribed and i will continue to support you. Thank you\n\nThe rant is now over. You can scroll up and watch the video now...."

-1,Comments:\nMy android phone did this in 2009\nSomething clever about how it's just red\nSteve jobs would hate this Spicy Orange strap
-1,Hey definitely ruined this with the fucking red thing how ugly is that🙄😠
-1,absolutely no immeasurable difference between all 3 of them
-1,"Frankly, why can't Apple come up with better form factors for the watch?  Why does it have to look so effeminate and generic that is so bland and boring?  Seems the place (Apple) is run by engineers.  None of the products raise any heartbeats.  One would expect more from the richest company in the world!"
-1,I hate people telling me Android did it first. \n\nApple did it right. \n\nHave you seen how ugly the other smart watches are? \n\nHave you seen how bad the other smart watches software is?
-1,the ending has me weak
-1,built in obsolescence - not worth it.
-1,Dumb
-1,stupid idea to make the  button red. Apple is being destroyed by B grade designers.
-1,You comedians are never happy with anything anyone who doesn't conform to your ideology does.
-1,Liberals are retarded this British Horse Teeth Retard is not funny only talented thing about him is his retarded accent.

-1,Fucking shut you got your sources from CNN
-1,"Trump is a winner, Democrats are losers!"
-1,"Fuck Donald Trump and his criminal,👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿"
-1,Why is this propaganda up on YouTube again? Trump hasn't done anything that hurts liberals feelings this week so what are you going to talk about? It's sad how YouTube is so biased that they'll post this shit but wouldn't even pass a single video commemorating the survivors of 9/11 and the people who have fallen
-1,Trump could save a puppy from drowning and John Oliver would find something wrong with it
-1,Number 4 on trending?! Are you fucking kidding? It isn't even his.
-1,"Why aren't you covering the trial of San. Mendez who is on trial for criminal charges. The Sen. is fighting an up hill battle and will be lucky if he does not spend time a cross bar hotel with some of his constituents that were not the recepients of the DNC''s effort too help the lower class. oh... I am so obtuse! The Sen. is Democrat and we don't want anyone to here about that kinda stuff! \n\nYou will have shit ratings when Hillary is on trial.  The American public is patient, and won't forget... ever."
-1,If John Oliver keeps insulting them for stupid crap Trumps gonna win again. Trump ain't my favourite but it's quite obvious.

-1,"He's actually better than his band, and he's awful"
-1,This is terrible. The way he sings it makes him look like the least talented out of all of them and its not as though anyone playing an instrument would have to try particularly hard playing it. Maybe just ruined this song for me.
-1,What a wanker. You're not worthy of singing this song.
-1,Why isn't the military doing something about this?!?!?!

-1,Solar powered chicken coop is next
-1,"All that sand, gravel, tamping .. seems like a waste?  since installers propped it up on 8 shimmed pads around the outside edge .. the gravel there will wash out over time and/or ground will heave.  Some 3' post holes and 4x4 pressure treated posts would last for decades, and remain level .. and eliminated the ugly shim pads."

-1,Wtf is wrong with your hair cut?

-1,It’s so sad that corn tortillas are so expensive around here
-1,This channel is starting to tap into the vegan hell on youtube. It's been an hour and I already see comments lecturing people on why eating meat is morally wrong and that you should be ashamed. Next we will have vegan gains community coming over.
-1,"The problem here is that vegan food is way too expensive, produce is absurdly priced in most places, especially avocados, and cashews are expensive too. Meat is and always will be cheaper."

-1,Pink is a man no doubt
-1,Make this a series and I'll watch the fuck out of it. Anything Watanabe gets his hands on is a masterpiece.
-1,"Was pretty awful to be honest, although I can see how all the normalfags will eat this shit up as it is all style no substance. I really hope the movie isn't like this or it will go down as one of the worst sequels ever I fear."
-1,Im not sure an EMP in one place could affect the whole world since earth is generating a magnetic field.\nOr maybe flipping the magnetic field could do it.
-1,"if we die do we go to heaven?\nthere is no heaven or hell for us, this world is all we've got\n:("
-1,Almost every line spoken was terrible. Might've been better with even less dialogue.

-1,IF ANIME HAD THE SAME HOLLYWOOD FUNDING THIS SHIT HAS OH MY LORD.
-1,"What a boring, unoriginal POS."
-1,I likes dis shit nigga..
-1,I really hope they are not pulling an Alien Covenant type of crap with these shorts.
-1,How do you learn to talk like this?? Seriously someone link me a video I MUST adopt this accent it is everything
-1,"I like John, but I hate this character he’s made. Look at his first video to now, this accent is so fake and not necessary"
-1,More weird looks! This totally made me want to be an alien for Halloween. 😍😍😍
-1,I'm really not a fan of them. I think they're slightly rancid. I'm cackling with wild abandon here! :'D
-1,"when i apply gel liner in the waterline, i take the end of a brush and dip it in the liner, it irritates my eye less"
-1,You're simply a breath of fresh air. I'm upset over the immense amount of time I've wasted on less-than-brilliant channels these past few years.
-1,“Slightly rancid”
-1,"This is sum weird scary shit but, Why is it you either upload or i instantly get a recommended video of you when I'm absolutely starving? it's honestly like YouTube knows something!"
-1,Who's here just eating a plain cheese pizza in abou 3h
-1,Please do a Boba Challenge. \nPlease do a Boba Challenge. \nIts Milk Tea and a Shit Load of Boba.
-1,"Please please please make a vlog video about your stomach. How you feel during and after crazy challenges. I wanna hear about cramps, gas, and especially poops. Yes, I’m extremely interested in gastroenterology and you’re a super human when it comes to eating. Just wanna know what comes next for the next day or two once the camera shuts off!!"
-1,$100 for a 14'' pizza? What a fucking rip off.
-1,100 bucks is not worth
-1,"Where is that guy who always start counting down with \n\n\n7,6,5,4,3,2,1 Gow"
-1,The sauce was uneven and it was killing me
-1,So how do you eat so much and not get fat. Im lost bro teach me your ways :/
-1,"I'm curious. How do you feel after you eat so much? Do you feel sick, because I would get sick from eating 5 slices."
-1,"Matt, you should just do livestream of eating tons of food, I mean I kinda want to see you savor your food."
-1,Poor little Megyn. She can't hold a conversation. Why in the world does anyone think she can handle this sort of interview? So embarrassing.
-1,megyn is just so awkward.
-1,Megyn Kelly sucks on morning tv.  Who asks about plastic surgery during an interview about a movie.  Her “gotcha” style interviews sucks and hurts the TODAY show brand. Stars are going to start boycotting appearances because of her
-1,Megyn Kelly is horrible! I would never watch her show after seeing this!
-1,Kelly is not a people person and has zero charisma. This interview is so awkward.
-1,Omg that question to Jane Fonda was so inappropriate and ill timed! Horrible horrible horrible! Megan is so bad at this job it's startling.
-1,The interviewer couldn't make it more awkward for these legends with her imbecilic questions
-1,"Is MK interested in anything  besides appearances and age????? How shallow! (and that's a kindness!)\nwhatever made someone hire her in this capacity ??? nearly brainless. And the audience as well, WHY would they populate the seats for a program like this?"
-1,Megan: Lose the f**king pen! IT's stupid
-1,Queen Jane shoots down the vile Megyn Kelly. Take this witch back to the slime bucket that is Fox News.
-1,"I thought she said Arseholes at Night ! ( it's the American accent, I'm a Brit)  Terrible interviewer and possibly the most insulting dumbest cringeworthy ageist questions she could ask ... these two legends. And yet they were still gracious . Wish someone would give them the time they deserve and a respectful interviewer"
-1,Megyn just doesn't have a clue.....smh. She's not going to be accepted by anyone before too long.
-1,Horrible interview.
-1,1:51 Really Megan Kelly That like Bryanstars level of Stupid questions i mean come on.
-1,The only thing Megyn has going for her is her looks. She is terrible at interviewing. That is why her show is tanking.
-1,"man, do they live in the past or what?"
-1,Megyn Kelly screwed up here.  But sometimes I get the feeling these liberal celebrities try to throw her off balance on purpose because of the fact that she came from Fox News (which they absolutely hate).
-1,You know that something is seriously wrong with today's society when someone like Megyn Kelly is a somebody.
-1,MK is not for daytime TV - she does not relate - she is a hard news person
-1,Her show appeals to idiots. That's all
-1,What a hack job Kelly did on both of them ... yuck!  no more Meghan Kelly
