1,"No one fucking cares. You're a 12 year old. There comes a point where you're too old for the whole I'm so goofy and fun every second of every day schtick. Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged, white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job. Or you can't hair flip your way out of an inevitable date rape charge."

1,Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine
1,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist."
1,Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you
-1,You're telling me that you're not perfect and sometimes you fuck up? \nThat's wired..
1,Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man
0,Never apologise to the regressives
-1,"dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah"
1,Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration
0,PROCEED WITH CAUTION: \nThis comment section will give you stage 4 cancer immediately.
-1,this isn't a bad thing... shit happens
1,"I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled."
1,And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.
1,What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️
-1,"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist."
-1,pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.
-1,I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well
1,"Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller"
1,Y'all will forgive him for anything lol
1,i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..
-1,"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!"
0,"HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES\n\nIF YOU HAVENT MADE THEM, YOU ARENT HUMAN."
1,i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word.
0,"I don't see it as racist, but rather as an accident"
1,I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads
-1,People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it
1,"Its just a word, calm down"
1,"lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front"
-1,To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD
1,"So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans."
1,👈 watch by clicking here people's are entertaining
1,"Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened."
0,What did he say??
1,"Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/"
-1,If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period
-1,I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill.
0,Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
-1,Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao
0,I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves
1,Social justice warriors need to chill
-1,"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)"
-1,Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down 😂😂 btw I do like idubbz it was just an example
1,"say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much"
1,Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix
-1,"If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video."
1,"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke."
1,It's okay man👌👌
-1,"Weird, my thumbs up doesn't stay. Could it be corrupted YouTube again?"
-1,"The day nobody cares about the word is the day it loses its power over people. Don't try to tell me that I'm only saying this because I don't UNDERSTAND. I DO. People have been slaughtered before, Countries have been Defiled AND ENSLAVED.. USED AS PROSTITUTES. NOT ONLY YOU... WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THIS N WORD STILL ENSLAVE YOU?"
-1,Who gives a Shit .
1,"THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANES AND YET Y'ALLZ ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOME CRACKA WITH A POTTY MOUTH???\n\nSincerely, your friendly neighborhood Beaner."
1,"honestly I don't care I won't let the word overpower me, I always will care about you pewdie!"
-1,say the word cracker.. journos wont care because theres a huge double standard and they hate white people!
0,This guy's face screams 'I'm gonna kill myself'. He seems to have lost all zest for life.
0,Blacks folks say that shit with every sentence and when whitey says it on accident without disrespectful thoughts the whole world turns.
1,It's ok Felix.
-1,"I think it is okay, you are sorry about that and it is done. Strange is, that we have here 2 kind of people. 1 which can say this word with N and nothing happen und the other people where everybody get insane. Just think of it."
1,Power is the disease.  Care is the cure.  Keep caring for yourself and others as best as you can.  This is life.

-1,People in the coments you are stupid hes an adult its not a mastake he should know not to say it stop defending him all the time
-1,Y'all are stupid
-1,I bet you only 10% of the people getting triggered by him saying the n word are actually black.
-1,Hey Felix who care? The context is what matters. We know you are not a racist. Don't feed into these stupid narratives.
1,"Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!"
-1,Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf
-1,"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell."
-1,Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it.
-1,"You are basically the face of YouTube. For someone who has woken up from a coma since before YouTube was around you'd be the first thing they'd know about YouTube. I know you have all this pressure under your shoulders because if you say anything wrong, it would be like the YouTube logo walked on stage and said: Fuck off! \n\nIt's hard to control how you are and speak, I know it, and I feel bad for you. You didn't have to apologize, as you said nigger to a yellow fucking blob, but you did."
0,All these people that are saying you should say what ever you want are also trump supporters.
0,Pewd you don't have anything to apologize for... it's just a word
0,"Thank you for apologizing pewds, i haven't lost respect for you"
0,Sh*t happens carry on
1,Dude it's just a word. Maybe ppl shouldn't be getting so butt hurt to be honest.
1,It's not like he said Voldemort. Ain't no evil wizards gonna come out if you say the n word
1,lol its just a word
-1,If a black american says the n word it's called slang. If a black american can call us white people or typical white girls it's called fun. But if a white person says the n word he's a racist. K den
1,"People give power to the word they don't want to hear. If someone says the N word, let it slide. Because you're the one who's making it a bigger deal. Stop caring and things will cool off"

0,Still made in China
-1,Let time and technology turned iPhone X cheaper. For now I'll settle down with my secondhanded 6s. I have skipped 7 anyway and definitely won't buy 8.
1,How are Chinese going to secure their phones???
1,"The phone itself looks pretty great but it isn't worth the $1,000. I'd say wait a while before buying it so the price can lower. By March next year it's probably gonna be the same price as the IPhone 7 is now."
1,"1,000 ?! . No thank you . Great phone tho . You know how many things I can buy with that"
1,"I'm not an apple fan, had iPhones for years in the past before being overcome with boredom stemming from the stagnant design and underwhelming yearly reveals. Currently loving on my gorgeous s8 plus, HOWEVER, the iPhone X is absolutely beautiful, and for the first time in years I'm actually kind of excited about an apple product. Also can't wait to see how Samsung responds, competition means better products for consumers. Nice work apple:)"

1,Damn I wonder how much longer until we're looking like futuristic movie

0,Stealing not having a home button just like the Samsung galaxy s8
0,That's the 8 the iPhone x is different
1,"To me, it's just a waste of money. Samsung galaxy note 8 is better"
-1,"If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly. Poor iPhone 9 and 7 doesn't get an s model. Next year, remove the numerics and refer to it only as iPhone the same way the numerics no longer exist for iPads or a MacBook."
1,If you look at the top you can see the camera they're using to film the iPhone is seeing the IR blasts coming from the sensor.

0,I Done! I'm going back to flip phones! Where can I buy a Motorola RAZR?
-1,"Face recognition is the most stupid thing ever imo. I can get into my S5 just as fast, and with way more simplicity with my pattern lock. And is it just me or does that look like a past display screen, it's the complete opposite of an infinity screen and looks ugly."
1,"apple claims this is the first OLED screen which is good enough for the iPhone..... but it's a lesser screen to the S8 and G6.... and the claim is bullshit, the thing about this good enough stuff is about profit margins...."
1,You guys are Giving more reasons to swich back to iphone.

1,"I wanted a better phone, if I wanted a camera I would have bought a Nikon."

-1,Ben carson on paper looked like a put together fella. Then he started talking on tv. Now we all know there is something terribly wrong with HIS BRAIN.
1,"Carson, Pruit, Devos and Price were deliberate selections by Trump and Bannon to destabilize the US government. Good job. Gobshites!"
1,It's harder to become the best nurosurgen than to become part of the public housing
0,Trump literally didn't know who Fredrick Douglas was.  He just recently discovered Lincoln was a Republican (before Republicans switched to being the racist party during the Civil Rights era).  He thought health care was five dollar a month life insurance. He doesn't know how to spell heal.  He's STOOOOOPPID.

1,I don't know wether to laugh or cry anymore when I see these clips...
1,"Paul Ryan has not yet come to terms with the fact that Ayn Rand is power pornography for teenage boys at a certain stage of aching virginity -- and normal kids get over it.\n \nA lot of people throughout RepublicanLand have variations on the same problem.  They really believe a scientifically incorrect notion, that human beings are independent of one another.  It may feel like that for the lonely teenager, but it's never, ever, true.  \n \nFrom that falsehood, they then build up moralities, generally ugly, histories, false, and a subset of both: self-serving aims or purpose.\n\nThis high-minded purpose gives us a HUD Secretary who is opposed to the Department of HUD, a Secretary of Health (named Price!) who believes that all medicine should be commercial.  You've got a guy over at Environmental Protection who is on the side of the folks continuing to dig the hole deeper.  All with the highest moralities he's been able to find anywhere! \n \nThe good Doctor Carson is really, really, one of the gang.\n\n-dlj."
1,It is Trump's goal to dismantle the US government and leave it in so much chaos that Russia is able to become the largest super power again.

1,Lmao this man is a walking punch line!
-1,"Does he only operate on foreign children, or is he just taking a break from helping? I guess we shouldn't get on Carson too much for his worst answer to a marathon Q&A, but jeez this guy."
0,"Hold up... The Abbot is Wu leader... GFK is a king, no doubt, but... Rza tho"
-1,Well… The brain surgeon Ben Carson just proved how truly insane he is…
1,Trump eliminated the programs we needed the most. Not wise.
1,Glad I never had him for a doctor
0,I wish Ben Carson was my grandpa...
1,Please go bck to surgery. No freaking experience in this position. That's new normal in administration .  Imagine him performing brain surgery without any training. A disaster!! The most powerful position in world also has no experience but you need experience to get almost  any other job.  Sick
1,Well the people of Texas probably shouldn't have voted for the person bragging about slashing relief funds huh. Hindsight really is 20/20
1,What did he take away from this [trip] today?\nMy luggage!\n\n... but maybe that only adds an extra layer of humour if english is not your mother tongue? ;)
1,"Trump sees HUD primarily as a tool for enriching well-connected real-estate developers, Carson’s combination of loyalty and ignorance may make him uniquely “qualified” for the position. 😠"
1,And this guy is a brain surgeon; wonder how many lawsuits against him?  He's despicable!

1,"My two biggest disappointments from this event are 1 the iPhone 10 not having a full 2k display and the screen only putting out 625nits of max brightness. That's a little less than half the max brightness of the galaxy note 8. I understand it will  be better than the Note 8 in lots of other ways, but I wanted it to match or be better in every conceivable way so the android fans wouldn't have anything to hold on to."
-1,Facial recognition! No way! Oh wait my damn Nexus 4 had that shit. God apple is so pathetic these days
1,"So...we're just going to overlook how advanced technology is becoming to describe you? LOCATION, FINGER PRINTS, FRONT FACING APPLE ID UNLOCK......l'll pass."

-1,Am I the only person who finds the shape of the screen unappealing? It looks like the screen has ears.
1,My first question is: Where do other notification icons go?
1,👈 watch by clicking here you can see People's are entertaining
-1,stupid face id. so what is you are a twin. should have stuck with touch id for security
1,"Look at all these poor Shitsung folks in the comments... Putting personal preference aside, no matter how you slice it, Apple will come out with the new best-selling phone on the market, again. It will be the fastest phone on the market, again. It will have the most used features, largest and most well-developed App Store, and highest adoption rate of hardware & software out of every single phone on the planet. People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years. In the end, none of the debate matters when it's Tim Cook who will be sitting on top of his massive cash pile with the first TRILLION DOLLAR-VALUED company in the world. Can't argue with facts people. BUT, I'm sure you'll find a way!"

1,Like this or you'll become gay
1,...From a emoji *uses the poop emoji* this is the best shit from the new iPhone though.\ndude...
0,brb* going to whore myself for this phone
0,I think people won't complain about the headphone jack if Apple Ships their iPhones with wireless earbuds.
1,What if u just show a picture of the iPhone owner's face to unlock the phone lolol
1,I liked the what does the fox say joke
1,"There is no 9, because 7 ate 9! Okay I'll go now...."
0,how can you take a screenshot ??
0,That gesture reminds me of the BlackBerry 10 OS
-1,Specs are fine but imo..... Hate the design for the hell of everything!
-1,$1000 for a phone?!?! WTF. then iPhone XI will come out in six months but this time it will be larger. geez
1,Talking shit emoji! That is classic! Thank you Apple engineers for making it real
0,Why can't anyone build a phone without camera bumps?
0,No reason to buy it
0,"iPhone 10. If you're going to use numerals for your prior devices numerals it is. Now if they had revealed the iPhone VIII and iPhone VIII+, then I would use X as in x-ray. Either way, I won't be going to a phone that only allows facials for biometrics."
1,"This looks cool enough, but i prefer the older style of iphones more, so i'll probably stick to iphone 8"
0,Does it come up with preloaded 4k porn??
0,Gonna buy the iphone X *ASAP* ! It got animated emojis guys like wtf you want more ?
1,Did the idea of having a  microsd never crossed apples mind??!? And why isn't there a headphones jack !!!!face Id is nice but why remove the touch Id!????
-1,"I don't get it. Since it has 3D Touch, why didn't Apple incorporate a hard press at the bottom of the screen to go home? Swipe seems less intuitive."
1,Why dont TMobile sell google phones? Ive seen them get the best ratings for cameras etc but why arent they more mainstream?
1,"as a left handed iPhone user, I´m wondering, if you can go to the Control Center by swiping from the left top corner, too? :/"
1,"*I think the iPhoneX is beautiful, can't wait to get my hands on one. Also interested to see what case companies do for iPhoneX phone cases. 🤔*"
-1,Literally looks like a bad version of the s8 mixed in with some bad Chinese Android knockoffs.
1,New phones rolling out every year with minor design changes to keep hype going and getting more expensive. Over-marketing strategy.
0,"How will face id help chinese unlock the fone, they all look the same😂😝"
1,This is a really nice phone but the price makes it hard to justify against something like the Galaxy S8 or Essential phone
1,"If you drop these phones, you're lucky if both glass panels don't shatter simultaneously...screen and back. But iPhone buyers have enough money anyway...so it hits no beggars. lol"
0,Hmm can't say I'm too into the look of this phone... I think I'm gonna go with the LG V30 this year.
1,hahhaha you fool...ass hole ...there is nothing new
-1,"Eehhhhhhh, its a disappointment. The s8 and note 8 are miles ahead."
0,Is it just me or does the iPhone X frame look chunkier compared to the S8+?
1,"Beautiful design but if I'm going for anything, it will be keeping my 6s and getting the Apple Watch with cellular"
1,"People complaining about the notch are imbeciles. How else were they supposed to go full screen and still fit the speaker grille, sensors & front camera in there? iPhone X is gorgeous, imo."
1,they took gesture tech from blackberry 10 phones. BB was really good. Missing it.
-1,"Really ? You don't have any complaints right off the bat? That's kinda sad, I saw you as a reliable source of information."
0,I will not be wearing a case with iPhone X
-1,I was really curious about that iPhone 9 thing too. Apparently it's the iPhone X because it's the ten year anniversary
1,Hats off for the owners of Apple for all the money they are going to make with their new overpriced gadgets.

0,When are they gonna be on sell ??
0,Do they have to pay some sort of fee to touch and use the phones??
1,"I have Apple products but I can’t justify paying $1,000 for this phone. Seems like they need to bring in people who are more inventive."
1,My galaxy S8 is still better. Switching to android from Apple has been my best decision this year.
0,"Dont you dare call it iphone x, accidentally says iphone x 😂😂"
1,It's cool but not a 1000 bucks cool
-1,How do you turn the phone off if holding down the button activates Siri?
0,Does this thing know how to suck a dick?
1,EVERYONE holds their phone by the sides....WHY THE FUCK is the power button on the side instead of the top to prevent accidental pressing and having to unlock the phone AGAIN!?!?!?!   (super major gripe with every phone out there....designers are morons)
1,I worry about certain games that require you to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to play and that might constantly trigger the back to home screen function.
0,yay i can afford a 4s now
1,the iPhone 8... skips to 10...\nWindows 8... also skips to 10...\n;)
1,Hell man I'm tripping on a 1000 bucks really
1,"I prefer iPhone 8 over 10, ‘cause iPhone 10 looks like one of those android phones with a similar design. iPhone 8 looks more of a iPhone instead of 10."
0,How do you power it off if the power button is now a Siri button?
1,Finally i will be able to buy iPhone SE
1,Everyone just getting all their new Apple stuff while i still cant afford the actual fruit smh -_-

Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates."

0,Attention celebrity assholes. What's your carbon footprint? Did you match Donald trump's million dollar donation? Do you know the term hypocrite?
1,"Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others don’t? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities?"

1,"Why are people like “Rich people asking the poor for money.” You’re basically saying, “Lets not help other human beings in need because the rich should be able to take care of it themselves.” News flash, they are donating their money, but you are NOT entitled to THEIR money! Just like you work hard for yours, they worked hard for theirs. Just giving yourselves reasons to be stingy and lazy."

1,"most of these rancid celebs ARE PAID to show up... dont support them, and  donate to better charities"
-1,@28:55 the epitome of decadence and creepiness. These people are out of touch creepozoids! Just look into their eyes.... they do not give a shit... they would kill you and eat you for dinner just to be trendy in a second. They disgust me... anything they do disgusts me. Using this tragedy orchestrated and allowed by the government in order to punish Trump and spew race based GARBAGE and get off on themselves as if they are actually DOING someting>>>> they make me want to VOMIT RIGHT IN THEIR FACES! They are not taking calls on those phones... its all fake its all phony! We are on to your sick mind games.
-1,All the celebrities should join together and help the hurricane tragic damages. The people have supported and help them become famous they need to put their money where their mouth is. The people don't want to see or hear stupid ass shows. This show probably took a lot of money to set up the funds should go to Houston.
1,"Most of the deviation videos were places in Dickinson, yet they said it was all Houston. we need help in Dickinson come on guys!"
1,Wow thats cool they invited big girl with a powerfull voice. Hope all the people get there money
1,Colbert? Really? I wonder how many people said FU and changed the channel as soon as they saw that asshole.
1,I wonder what the administrative overhead is for this organization? I would rather see these celebs roll up their sleeves and do some actual work.. You would be better off donating to Mercury one 100% of your donation goes to the cause at hand.
-1,Do not ever give money to events like this!! Very little money if any goes to the victims
1,"If celebrities, business owners and VIPs involved donated $100k each you would reach the goal hours ago.  Donald Trump donated $1 Million, the Kardashian Family 500k.  Also I really really really hope the money goes to the victims not an organization or government."
1,This is exactly what the US deserves after a decade of imperialism and war-mongering. Die!

-1,I hate that they are taking this opportunity to slip in identity politics and their own agenda at the expense of this tragedy. Like really?
0,nobody made a joke about trump or called him out ?? WOOOOOOOOW i cant belive it
1,"Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves. God bless 💕"

1,"Forget about raving about your favorite stars, or putting down the government and the Presidents- current and past.  This event was about the displaced people and the help they need.  God expects us to love one another and this is a very good place to start!  Did all of you who have left comments about your stars or bad feelings about the government donate anything or are you just wasting energy that could be used in helping others?  Stop for a second and think what you can do to help your fellow man, woman and child who might be in need.  Maybe you cannot give the $25 they are asking for, but you can give smaller amounts- every amount is accepted."

I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

1,"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding. That's usually where the magic happens."

If you think your so smart then think about this, this is one guy who is trying to entertain you while being pressured by the millions of people to trick them.

1,Yes his trick is obvious. But me personally. I like his presentation. I like how he always starts the presentation with something random (how did he known howie's passcode?) And then they way he talks and the way he looks and how humble he is. And I also like how he's not a singer. He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive.
1,This is mind blowing. But we all know a singer or a dancer will win
0,He should be the winner
0,THIS MAN IS NOT FROM THIS WORLD DUDE
1,I know how he did it. When he grabbed the paper that Mel picked he had a little piece of paper in his hand it put it over the paper that was grabbed off the table and just made sure his finger was at the spot when they said stop.
1,I noticed he took the paper with his left hand and then for a split second with his right he put something on the paper. It was a small sticker .notice how he kept his right hand on THE paper the whole time?
1,"this guy is part of the show. hes like a cast. hes not gonna win. Hes just like a filler, to keep the show entertaining."
1,What kind of demon is he
0,Did no one tell this dude he looks like Hitler
1,"Ok, he sure is very good at messing around with unconcious mind"
1,"Cool but, I got a triple kill in BO2 with an RPG once"
-1,u can tell mel is single.
1,Hello Americans..please let this man win..A magician deserves to win AGT 2017...enough of singers..
1,This guy deserves to win. My opinion
1,is the best M best on this planet
1,I predict that he will win the show.
1,Simple. Tiny sticker on his finger. He places it when Heidi zeroes in on her chosen area on the card. Look at when its zoomed in. The choices are literally smaller than the size of his fingertip making it easily stickable on the card.
0,Now you see me 3
0,i think he put a sticker or something on the card that mel chose to make it look like she chose ellen rome cheese and heidi was in on it
0,The hell happened to Mel's hair
0,Am i the only one who noticed that he is dressed as Mr. Bean..
0,He added the sticker after she picked .  also you can see he wouldnt let go of the paper when Heidi was trying to grab it to read.
0,I need this guy in my life
1,The singers are great the dancers are amazing but this my friends IS TALENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ONE OF A KIND! I am shoook!
-1,SO insane you can see him sticking the tweet on top of another one. Big whoop.
1,Can u guys help me get 200 subscribers I'm so close please I'll be so happy
-1,I would assume this to be some masterful slight of hand where he slipped the paper from a hidden spot is his sleeve then forced to selection of the tweet on Heide. Much better done than the last time where he made a terrible mistake
0,*I want somebody to explain what he did*\nPeople catch the tricks all time.  I can't on this one.
0,3:05 watch at .5x speed. You can  see he cups the tweet in his hands  and puts it on the paper
1,It's not about the piece of paper in his hand. It's about how he is able to mentally convince an entire audience that magic is real with a simple trick.
0,Don't bring this guy into the Dunkin' Save again America!!!!!
1,this guy is a global threat lol
1,"Mell looks like a better looking Elsa.....\n\nFor those of you who don't know who Elsa is, shes my ex-friend....\n\n\n\n\ncold hearted bitch😒"
1,WOW. You guys better give him a 10.
1,"I figured it out. At 3:06, after Mel hands him the card, he takes his right hand out of his pocket and puts what I would assume a sticker on there and then forces her to stop on Ellen, Rome, Cheese. Still a fantastic performance!"
-1,Alright as much as I hated his last 2 very fake acts this one has be stumped
1,"MAGIC TRICK REVEALED:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe palms a sticker containing the desired tweet Ellen Rome Cheese, then at 3:17 he rubs the sticker on to the card and forces Heidi to read the tweet even though she didn't pick that tweet."
1,This act wasn't that good... To do the trick he had a sticker in his hand and when Heidi said stop he places the sticker on top of the previous tweet so he already knew it was going to be Ellen Rome Cheese
1,OMG!!! I'm Impressed!!! Now we can believe in Magic XD
1,He's winning

0,this guy has personal nigger
1,The facial recognition for sure. Plus the entire casing and the big screen. Loving those with the iPhone 10
0,Take a look at the charger haha\nhttp://amzn.to/2f59rju
1,Nova launcher does that they copied android with this 999 bucks atached a 6 core really most high end android are 8 core or higher
1,Is  reachability  gone now from iPhone X ?\nIf it is so then i think Apple has dropped an important feature. 😐\nIt is much more required now in that screen size
1,> hands on > most of the video is a man in a room
1,Giveaway? Can't wait. I'm new to the apple family haha
0,Well now we can't even hold our phone while it's charging
1,"Pause at 0:28, you're welcome."
-1,"People are saying this looks like the s8, but the s8 has a bezeled display so I'm confused..."
1,Everything? :/ There are many other things I'd like to see
1,i love everything about the iPhone X (ten)!!!!!!
1,Jonathan Morrison and iJustine want the silver X. Classic look. I know what Jon Rettinger is getting... 😉\n\nLess fingerprints will be shown in most indoor lighting.\n\nCan be recognized easily as a X with the vertical camera hump and not be mistaken as a black 7 from afar. \n\nKinda a throwback to the two-toned original iPhone that helped launch their YouTube/tech career.\n\nSilver X it is.  Even my space gray SE isn't consistently all black from front and back and it's the most beautiful iPhone ever made.
1,The last time I was this early the iPhone still had a headphone jack
1,"Wayyyy to expensive, I'm completely neutral to all smartphones but the iPhone X is just a Galaxy S8 that costs $300 dollars more"
1,So no touch id? Wow what a trash a phone
1,"I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks."
1,I have a feeling that everyone you know will be able to unlock your phone with face id cos they can just hold up a picture of your face and it will just unlock
-1,Stainless steel looks ugly on it too shiney. Should've stayed with aluminum.
1,Cool! But that price tag tho...
-1,"Are updates for Mobile Legends on iOS still late? If not, ML would be sweet on this expensive little shit."
1,Screen!! hands down is my favorite feature of iPhone X
1,The iPhone x wipes your butt while you watch videos the iPhone x is garbage and rubbish and has no real actual crap to offer you but go ahead and spend a grand on me I am the iPhone x I will know your secrets and I will keep your soul I will tell you that there are new things when there really isn't my megapixels have not changed and stayed the same since the iPhone 5 yes my camera can now clearly detect a pimple on ones butt. just remember the iPhone X is the best and I am your phone God come to me my Apple peasants please Apple peasants come to me iPhone x needs your money
1,I find it hilarious how all of the new iPhone's new specs have all been used before

1,"....How much did it cost to get into an event like this? It couldn't have been free. Either you get in there by knowing someone (or being that someone), or you pay a lot of money. \n\n...Either way, I would never go to one of those events. And I'll never pay that much for a phone. Absolutely unreasonable in my books."

-1,Man i wish i could get the phone but unfurtionaly irma happen orlando got hit pretty hard
1,Omg the iPhone X is soooo cool I really love it
1,"Ahh my top all favorites for the iPhone X is the dual 12-megapixel camera, and the placement of the flash was a genius thing. This way the flash is evenly distributed over both cameras. This will definitely result in high-quality pictures. Next is the Facial ID, now that is impeccable!! Also the 5.8 OLED Display..OMG, magnificent!! I love this upgrade!! \nThnx for the review Jonathan!"
1,Love that some of my favorite YouTubers all worked together to get footage!! YAY!!!😄
1,Your video is on point as usual. I'm excited for the Face Id feature.  Thanks for the video!!

-1,"$1,000 tho? Who the fuck would pay that much for a phone? It's so stupid how crazy people go over a phone."
-1,"'...unfortunately no 512.' Dang, to even think that's possible is insane. Just a few years ago 64gb was top notch storage, now it's standard 😱"
0,That phone is looking sexyyyy...........not
1,Yeah I can’t stand that top bar it’s so goddamn terrible looking!!!!!. For me it’s not about the money price I will be definitely going for the 256 gig. I don’t know if I can leave touch ID. But that top bar I just can’t deal with it watching movies playing games I don’t know what the hell Apple was thinking about leaving the top Bar like that.. And the Face ID I still can’t trust it. There was a video where a guy puts the phone up to an Apple employee’s face and unlocks the phone. Without his permission. So what stop’s the police or anybody trying to Unlock your phone without your permission. I still feel like the face ID has some security flaws..
1,I can just say that display is finally beauty.And it's made by Samsung Not bad.

Then there's the heart disease risk, as chicken has almost the same amount of cholesterol and saturated fat as beef."

-1,Now this is the shit!
1,the idea of the movie is great but what about Birds insects rain animals in general and aren't you going to die from hypothermia if you're outside in the winter hopefully they explain some of this otherwise great idea
-1,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that."
1,My first thought was that this looks like a crapy comedy movie but it looks more like a interesting light hearted movie instead. I'm going to keep my eye on it and if it gets decent reviews I'll go to see it.
1,"Interesting, though now since they are small wouldn't they be further down on the food chain and wild animals, insects and such would most likely kill them?"

1,Really curious to see how the premise of this movie is construed as an Aesop. There are so many ways this movie can be manipulated to present a specific moral standpoint.
-1,Why does Matt Damon sound like Owen Wilson in this? Wtf
1,Saw the thumbnail and thought this looks stupid. Watched the trailer and I'm very intrigued. Good for Paramount to pick up something with a quirky premise :)
-1,That's a stupid idea... imagine being attacked by an ant or a cockroach..
1,I think the whole shrinking process is an inside project orchestrated by the government to kill as many people as possible with efficiency.

1,How do so few people die? Like OMG that's still decent. 1800 died in New Orleans in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina.
1,Today two of chickens were attack by a coyote\n\nI would like to say I loved them \n\nThis had to happen right when they were starting to lay eggs
1,Cuba's president nice joke

0,People die all the time...100 died in car wrecks yesterday... I'm dying rite no....w....😫
-1,just 10? God dammit....step it up nature. at this rate it'll take thousands of years for the humans to go extinct.  gotta upgrade the hurricanes.
1,"I can't believe people are actually complaining that it was 10 people. 10 people could have been your loved ones or even you. They are brothers, sisters, mothers, aunts, uncles to someone. If you have nothing positive to say. Leave."
1,"Far-left journalists before Irma = Cuba has the best protocol to protect their citizens, they will have no casualties\nAfter Irma = . . . . . . . . . ."
1,"Best of luck to Cuba. As a south Floridian, I've experienced wilma and now Irma. Both felt identical in damages. Depressing aftermath for both storms but blessed that both were far from catastrophic. Irma was a storm that only hit the Caribbean hard. I can only imagine how bad it is in Cuba right now. Sending my condolences to the lives lost."

STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep"
1,"it’s so sad that many people have never experienced how cubans live . i, myself am cuban . i was born there but moved to america. many people don’t understand that simple evacuation is hard . and with trump not letting cubans enter america easily is much worse . and for the people saying 10 is nothing . it’s A LOT. most cubans are often acquainted with many people and everyone is very caring for everyone else and people are very close. So 10 is a lot even though it seems like nothing here ,it’s a lot for Cubans. And in regards that Cubans barely have any health , medicine or basic living supplies most Cubans die of diabetes and many other diseases and it’s very sad."

1,"10 is actually a good number, considering it was the strongest storm to ever hit Cuba. And let she honest, Cuba isn't exactly a country of incredible infrastructure and solid buildings. So the death toll could have been astronomical."
1,"What, I can't hear you. I was attacked by sonic weaponry...... sorry, good luck."
1,It didn't happen in america so we don't really care.

I'm a born n raised Tennessee boy outside of Memphis and even though some parts I lived wasn't country it was still a lot like these lyrics. After my service with the Navy I ended up moving out here to California because of someone I thought was an angel and a friend, still... I do miss a lot in Tennessee and one day I'll come back home. This song seems to tell me something like it's a sign I should move back... The universe has a funny way to reveal things"

Somehow you make a great Broncos game feel like a chore. But it wasn't, was it? This was one of the best games all week!\n\nOn the Broncos front, we might have made a huge mistake by cutting TJ Ward and will be drafting Safety high next year. We still need a better O-line in places. Siemian improved a lot, Jamal Charles is old. Poor Jamal."

-1,Shouldn't it just be illegal to pardon your buddies from the campaign trail? I mean that seems like a huge abuse of power.
1,just a friendly reminder that john oliver sucks ass🤡https://soundcloud.com/666satx/visions-of-color-audiozine-ep7-the-cutting-edge-of-liberation
-1,On psychologist wrap thin different forest extensive character bite occasionally.
-1,John  Oliver's a Racist Scum.
1,"if conservatives are so keen on upholding the constitution and all american rights, they seem pretty quick to throw them out the window if it satisfies their need for putting other people down."
-1,If Donald Trump meant Job in a biblical sense... he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about he's just spouting words he is allowed to say on camera...
-1,"Don't you people get it now? Legal , illegal only applies to certain people."
-1,Let's see how tough this racist old fuck is when released among the inmates in his own tent city. He would shit his geriatric diapers before even getting there. Toughest Sheriff... please. May Arpaio rot in prison. Criminal scumbag.
1,"I agree 100%, Sheriff Arpaio should not have been pardoned and should have gone to one of his own jails.  \n\nBut where were you, Mr. Oliver, when President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera?  As bad as Sheriff Arpaio was, and I think his deliberate malfeasance killed people, he wasn't in the same league as Mr. Rivera.  Among other felonies, he was the head bombmaker for a terror group, the FALN, that claimed credit for 120 bomb attacks, killing six and injuring dozens.  There are parallels: as with Sheriff Arpaio, Mr. Rivera was unrepentant and as with President Trump's pardon, President Obama's commutation was popular with a slice of his constituency."
1,Quick fact check....the record for highest temp in AZ is 128 degrees in 1994. Not 145 like in the video.
1,"This barely scratches the surface of corruption, cruelty and abuse of his office. I'm surprised Oliver didn't warn about the door left wide open for the Russia investigation. If Arpaio gets an instant pardon for his political and ideological fuckery, anyone who doesn't want to testify in the Russia investigation cannot realistically be threatened with contempt of court and appropriately jailed because Trump will just let them off the hook, which is by definition obstruction of justice; the exact reason this investigation is taking place."
-1,Wait john that story is false his white privilege stopped them form beating him to death ....cops dont hurt white people or white privilege wouldnt exist they need to fire this closet white supremacist and get a true black man up in there #supporteryourlocalantifa

1,"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades."

Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support."

1,"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic"

If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable. We can't drill oil forever, it's not sustainable"
0,Did I just hear Hyperloop? Please head on to Thunderf00t to be reeducated
1,Hyperloop doesn't work you know that right?
1,Great and interesting video as normal :).
-1,"Erm...just an FYI as someone who lives in Scotland & flys down south to Cardiff and London at least 8 times a year, flying is MUUUUCH cheaper and faster than the train."
0,I'm at the level of procrastination that I'm watching someone rate airplanes
0,Bombardier C-Series does all of this now and has the orders for them. Guess that's why Boeing is butthurt and putting out these videos.
1,"Everyone loves to complain about how uncomfortable planes are getting. Personally, I don't care. I don't ever make trans-continental flights, so sitting in an uncomfortable seat for a few hours isn't that big of a deal. And with the cost of tickets as they are I wouldn't be willing to pay more for a more comfortable experience. It's never been about the journey, just that I get there."
1,Barely any airlines operate the majority of their routes with 787s tho
1,"People are willing to pay more for greater speed or greater comfort... if they can afford it.  Wages have been flat for nearly a generation, so it's no wonder there isn't a huge market demanding supersonic flight.\n\nWhen I went to Hawaii I paid a little extra for a non-stop flight, and I'd have been willing to pay a little extra to make the trip in four hours instead of eight (oh my aching butt!).  But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.  If and when there is a market for such things, Boeing and Airbus and others will build them."
1,The problem will be this. Even with this gap filled the concern is accessibility. Because unlike train or car or bus travel you can pretty much just get on and go and not to slog through piles of security theater. So until we realize this i think the other forms will be more dominant.
1,Too much talking while showing clips that have nothing to do with the subject.
0,I believe the 787 was a replacement for the 767 so this would make sense
1,"Could you make a video about the C919, the new Chinese made airplane?"
-1,Don't know why some commenters are pissed about Boeing.\nWhat's wrong with that manufacturer?
0,When will fossil fuels run out? You make it a key part of the argument for electric power aircraft.
1,"By the year 2025, Boeing and Airbus will merge and create the Boebus Z5000 which will travel at 5,000 MPH. WIFI will cost $40 per MB and the cabin crew will still be old and/or gay"
1,it way cheaper to fly from London to Edinburgh than use the train already.
-1,"Correction needed: The Boeing 757-200 has a range of 4500 miles in a 200 seat configuration. The video states a 4000 mile range which is typical for the 757-300, but not for the 757-200."

1,Would be interesting to hear your point of view on the МС-21.
0,"But, the Airbus A380 goes from Paris to LA nowadays."
1,"the plane of the future........ I personally think it will be one where they put you to sleep simply so they can stack you on top of other passengers and pack people up like sardines simply for a larger profit , after all you cant complaint about your flight if you dont remember it right?"
1,"Your comments are very American and Wester European centric. The vast majority of future aircraft sales will be mostly in Asia since that's where the largest number of people live. In places like China and India which both have large populations and large surface areas, the more relevant point is one that you briefly touched on, namely the hyper loop. If that technology matures quickly, than it's far more likely that ere will be vast hyper loop networks rather than electric commuter aircraft. Also, why are you comparing aircraft with buses? They are completely on the opposite side of either an economic or technological discussion."
-1,"I dont know how you made me watch the entire video while the topic is fucking boring as fuck, great job."
0,Boeing boeing boeing...\nWill we ever even hear ONE compliment to airbus rather than praising boeing like a god.
1,"There are currently people talking about a possible Airbus A322 which would be a streteched A321 (more seat capacity) combined with an all new wing. This might be Airbus' answer to the MOM problem. The advantage would be a light and relatively cheap plane (compared to twin-aisle) and fleet-commonality with A319, A320 and A321 (minimizing extra-costs of sub-fleets). The disadvantage would be slower (de-)boarding, because of the single aisle and a tube-feel inside."
1,Love the video! I love that you include the metric system things!
1,"As I'm Japanese and living in Tokyo, frequently going to Osaka to see my friend, airplane's cheaper if you book it early. The bullet train doesn't have earlt discounted ticket like most of European countries do. And, the electric airplane sounds great but Tokyo-Osaka (Itami) route, JAL and ANA use B777-200, 300 or 787-9. 777-300 is configurated with about 500 seats. It's not like London Edinburgh. Japanese domestic flights are mostly operated by twin aisle aircrafts, so electric plane is pretty much impossible in capacity way."

0,An airplane of the future will look like a Boeing 727-200 DAMMIT!!!
1,"Transparent cabin walls , are you kidding me? _yeah ppl will love that_"
1,"Plane of the future will consist of one pilot and a Dog. The pilot feeds the dog,while the dog will make sure you touch the correct switches. That's automation for you."
1,"But why dont they just use the 787 to fill in that spot? Its fuel efficient, and has more seats than a 757."
0,Just got off a 11 hour flight and planes need to get WAY faster... pls
1,"Hyperloops will never be a real threat to planes in the future because we humans are destined to go to space, and between space and the ground there is the atmosphere, aka air, thus airplanes will be much more developped than hyperloops."
0,Bio fuel not electric planes are the future!
1,"besides competition is coming from comac (c919) & bombardier (cs-series) for the reigional market and airbus actually has something to fill in the gap, the a330 (albeit a bit too big) , and the a320 line sort of fit this gap, the range is fine but still shorter than the 757, and the capacity falls a bit short, the neo capacity is even worse\nthe thing about the 757 is that, the range and passenger ratio is just in-line (7000km~ with 220-240 pax), so its hard to replace\npeople might say the 767 is a replacement, the 200 yeah (250-290 pax), but they're also getting old and is still a bit too large, worse - the newer models are even bigger\nalso there is the A350-800 which could be a replacement, but ppl forgot that they can carry up to 440 pax, which in low demand routes doesnt make that much sense.\nso really the airline industry needed a single aisle plane on the 240-260 pax capacity with a range of over 7000km with an impressive fuel efficiency\ngod dammit boeing and airbus, shrink your planes\n\nother consideration is a possible combi type of plane, which 250~ is reserved for pax and the rest is for cargo, i mean that, on high demand times, could generate money, both from cargo and pax and thats a win-win in my eye\n\n\nidk why but everytime even on a supposedly non bias video there is a bias from the outside perspective of\nif it aint boeing i ain going"
1,"Electric planes?!? I believe biofuels are more likely. Not only does the technology exist, when fuel prices go up it will be able to compete with the cost. As biofuels become more used they will also drop in price. Battery technology isn't advanced enough."
1,"Actually, flying from Edinburgh to London is cheaper than the train (which are horrifically expensive in the UK now) - but people don't fly because the train can be quicker once you factor in airport security, waiting, etc and the fact that both airports are well outside their respective cities. People who fly tend to either be connecting in Heathrow, or live / work nearby. Working on the train is also more comfortable (a table the laptop fits on, power, wifi, decent coffee, etc for the entire journey)."
0,Plane of the future is No plane. This is like 100 years ago somebody predicting bullockcart of the future.
0,why no ads on the video?
1,"Sure, planes are faster than trains - if you don't count the hour you have to be there before take-off and the travel time to the airport, which is usually out of the way and probably not even in your city (plus transit to your final destination)…\n\nFor travelling from western Germany to the south it takes me a total of ~4-4.5h total travel time when using the plane and 4-5h when using the train. When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains )."
1,I'm surprised they still haven't utilized birdlike designs into their planes. Why constantly blast your engines for the entire duration of the flight when you can glide on flexible wings in between sustained bursts of propulsion?
1,They can't do super sonic because it damages the atmosphere
1,"No matter how good it is, people in the United States still have to spend more than hours in the airport at security checkpoint."
0,Hyperloop will never be a thing.
1,"Given the rising favour of electric powered transport compaired to combustion, there will have to be either a way to provide much more electricity than there is right now, or an extreme efficiency increase for electric, which at our state are both pretty unlikely. The UK is using about 90% of its electricity reserve and further strain will be put on it with just the electric car, so it makes you wonder if the future will be able to not run out of energy as it unfolds"
1,"I note this trend of planes spending so much time in the air that the _passengers_ are becoming increasingly interested in sleep.  Not the _crew;_ the _passengers._  I understand that planes are equipped to provide for the sleep needs of the pilot, the copilot, the navigator and the flight attendants, but what research is being done into providing for the sleep needs of _passengers?_  If we have a plane that is going to be in the air so long that there is no realistic way to ask a passenger to remain seated for the duration, and instead, it's more practical to provide them with _beds,_ can we foresee a day when this is a practical reality?"
1,"I highly doubt electrification is achievable for flight (at anything past prototype) and even if it was it's doubtful it would be cheaper than avgas. Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the cheapest forms of dispatchable power we have. \n\nThat said, with a large nuclear power fleet, we can create synthgas from seawater, the US Navy research labs have already proven this technology (think refueling planes on an aircraft carrier). Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one. If oil price goes up synthgas will be able to make serious money with an installed fleet so large that it's not going anywhere fast."
1,"Electric Aircraft: no chemtrails, lol thats never gonna happen, America has to be crooked"
1,"Hey! I have a small YouTube account and I'm struggling to take off, I'd really appreciate if you could take a look. If it's not your type of thing then you don't have to subscribe I understand but it's worth a try!😊"
-1,"Much like all of the future, it's extremely disappointing because what you wanted to happen is actually not allowed by the laws of physics."
0,"British Airways operate the A319, A320, A321 and 767 from Edinburgh to London"
-1,Algae Biofuels can fully replace fossil fuels. Unless there's dramatic new battery technology I don't see the feasibility of electric only airplanes. Both the energy density and charging times would have to be exponentially increased.
1,"The energy density of jet fuel compared to batteries is around 100:1.  Until battery technology improves, this will be the major roadblock for large electric airplanes.  Lilium has a concept that might work for transporting people for shorter ranges."
0,Some say that the planes of the future will already have skyscrapers attached...
1,"I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later."

0,I think you guys should have kids talk to someone with body dysmorphia
1,Bottom line: People perceive beauty by two things\n1. How it affects them emotionally with what their own senses can connect to (i.e. make they feel nice and find to be pleasing).\n2. From other people's perceptions and opinions.\n\nBut naturally unless you do a serious analysis on your understanding of a subject you would just have a vague unclear notion on it.
-1,This makes me so sad. I can't wait for the day when technology progresses enough that it allows these people to see.
-1,What I learned... Blind people are shitty just like regular people ohhh big shock.

1,38:00 ..........No Hillary everyone just wanted ANYONE other than you. After you threw Bernie to the wolves a ton of his supporters could not stomach voting for you. I would say I lean right politically but even i would of voted Bernie rather than have Trump or Hillary.
-1,anyone regretting not supporting Bernie or Johnson now?
0,Why is she around still?!?!!?! She lost to a cheeto face! She is a disgrace.
-1,I couldn't vote for her or Trump. It sucks having a conscience AND reasoning skills....
1,"-- Ezra Klein (3:14) Do you think that one of the lessons of watching Bernie Sanders, of watching Donald Trump, is that perhaps the correct role for policy in a campaign is to inspire? And that the place for technocratically sound, more pragmatic policy is in the legislative process? -- American politics centers on emotion, on charisma, on sensationalism. But it shouldn't. Voters shouldn't care about the color of a politician's toupee or pantsuit. What matters is process and, even more so, results, and the person (or, rather, team of people) managing that political process shouldn't be determined by a popularity contest. Without substantial electoral reform, voting directly for President of the United States will always, for most of the electorate, be tantamount to voting for a high school prom king."
1,This woman is a true a president.
0,Am I the only one that voted trump?
-1,Why is media even covering this disgusting woman anymore?
-1,Who cares what that idiot thinks
-1,"She says the right is anti-immigrant. Lies, we are anti ILLEGAL immigrant. People are dumb to buy her book. she's already a multi millionaire. Want to make millions, became an identity politics politician."
-1,Trump sucks .. ha ha you think Hillary is any better you moron! Hillary sucks .. ha ha you think Trump is any better you moron!
-1,"Haha the failure wrote a book solely blaming other people for her losing: Bernie Sanders, James Comey, etc"
0,She should be blaming herself and her shitty decisions not to mention her horrid campaign no1 trusted her or the string bean standing next to her
1,"I thought that this was a great piece. Regardless of what people may think about Hillary, she is undeniably eloquent and oh-so intelligent. You can really hear the thought and depth in her responses. They were actual, solid answers to his questions. Never once did she say: You're gonna be very happy with this interview. Lol"
1,"One year after the fact, and its amazing how much visceral hatred for Hillary still remains, and the extent to which it colours popular perception. She's written a book exploring what happened, which, no matter how you slice it, will mean looking at the reasons why she lost. Being able to reflect on that experience, mistakes and all - and learn from it is pretty important for anyone to be able to do. You won't get far in life if you can't do this. But slather this with kneejerk hatred and it suddenly becomes entirely a blame game! \n\nI mean, it takes a deep plunge into the the pit of 'alternative facts' to be able to watch this interview and come away with the conclusion that Hillary is simply doling out blame. And yet, here we are.\n\nI say this as an international observer - someone who hasn't been caught up with the hyper-partisanship and tribalism that is clearly afflicting many Americans - you guys need to take a step back and have a good look at yourselves and what you're becoming. What you've already become. When you can't tell fact from fiction at the most basic levels - when your prejudices are affecting your judgement to this extent, something has gone seriously wrong. And as alarming as this is - and it should be alarming to just about everyone - it appears like a huge segment of both media and laypeople (as evidenced in the comment section here) alike are clearly more interested in indulging in their hatred and self satisfied criticism, than giving any thought to the content of the discussion."
0,please run hillary so we can get another 4 years of trump
-1,"Giving Hillary airtime and mindshare instead of Bernie, when the former is busy profiting from book sales and interviews and the latter is attempting to introduce Universal Health Care and actively fighting Trump. smdh"
0,It takes an hour to say everyone's fault but mine?
-1,"Hate her all you want guys, but you have to admit, wouldn't it be nice to have a president who's actually informed and can converse intelligently on actual issues?"
1,Man listening to center-right corporate dems is like sitting through that annual PowerPoint presentation at work that no one wants to attend...can they all just be absorbed into the republicans already and we start a New Left?
0,"Why does Vox care what she thinks, she was the most corrupt politician in recent history and lost to Donald Trump"
-1,I still don't understand how people POSSIBLY think she's worse than Trump.
1,"hilary clintons democratic opponent bernie is still in government still fighting for what he believes is right, healthcare for all and free college, compared to hilary, who wrote a book about how bernie was the reason she lost...."
1,Can you own so much turquois?
1,What voter suppression is going on? Requiring an ID to vote makes it to where it is harder to cheat in elections. Election and voter fraud are a real thing. What is so racist about requiring an ID to vote?
1,Both her and Trump are in the same poo filled bag. #liarliarpantsonfire #goaway
0,Instead of Secretary Clinton he should've said Not President Ms Clinton
1,"Hillary Clinton wants to tell you 'What Happened' ... MH17 = MH370 = lord Watt illuminati agent getting cloned and send back to CIA EU , he loved that russian lady`s so much ."
-1,Thank God we did not elect this witch.
1,"One of Hillary's problems is that her positions on issues may have seemed more grounded, by they also didn't solve the problem. For example: When Sanders talked about public college being free (through a regulatory measure, similar to what is done in the UK), Hillary's proposal was tuition free college in which tax credits would be given to help subsidize the cost of college, but only for families below a certain income bracket. So you have tax money being used for college credits for certain people, which does nothing to actually curb the out-of-control costs of college education. All it does is give colleges an excuse to increase their tuition rates because now, the money would be coming from the government instead of students. \n\nAnother example: Universal Healthcare. Hillary said, 90% of people are covered, so it's easier to just get the other 10%. Maybe. But the 90% don't all have good, or affordable coverage. They're just covered. The plan of extending Obamacare further doesn't do anything to actually curb the out-of-control costs of healthcare, because her plan continued to see cooperation with the money-sucking insurance companies. See? There's a pattern here."

1,"Okay, but in all seriousness, she's still a politician, putting a camera and microphone on her is a pretty surefire way to not get her true thoughts out."
0,What did she accomplish again?
1,This was very good! Thoughtful and thorough! Nice I liked it! Good job! 🤗
0,The world dodged the biggest bullet with this woman
1,I actually really enjoyed this interview it really showed a human side of Hillary when so many people make her seem like a demon. I only wish it was conducted from a jail cell with shackles at her feet because she is a failed stateswoman that got nothing done and is a criminal against this nation and the rule of law.
-1,You know you're a fail when you lose to a commie and trump #maga
0,"Go away Hillary, we're just not into you..."
0,"Thank God this venal, mendacious, self-absorbed woman did not become president."
0,32:30 Thank you for pushing back on her assertion that donations *didn't* affect how Obama governed. Who was bailed out? Who was in his cabinet?
-1,"You can tell Ezra Klein has a past in sports, when he asks softball questions like this"
1,I voted for her but I still believe she is a flip flopping politician who owed to many people loyalty to make a truly good president.
0,Where was this Hillary during the elections? I didn't see her like this!!! What a shame...
1,"The irony as she rambles on one of the many, MANY leftist pushing media outlets about the right controlling the media."
1,"it's sad that the election candidates came to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are corrupt liars the best America has to choose from? oh wait, that is what politics in general has become"
0,I want this lady to come back next election and come back stronger.
1,"She should have done universal basic income, universal healthcare, and other socialism. Then the far right and far left would've had a better meme war. Centrists are boring.\n It I guess what she is saying is that some of that isn't practical, and she wouldn't have been able to explain how it would get done?"
1,Who else wishes she spoke clearly like this during the election itself?
-1,the only thing Hillary did wrong was be too polite
1,"yeah, attack the media, obama, joe biden, bernie but not you. gj hillary, classic female."
1,I actually really enjoyed this interview.
1,"I definitely think Hillary Clinton's viewpoint that the American people care about details, analyses, facts, and legislative precision was inaccurate. A large portion of both the primaries and the general election *is* a personality contest, whether we like to admit it or not. You need to learn to appeal to different crowds while still maintaining a focus on your agenda items.\n\nIt wasn't that Hillary didn't have that focus - I think she expended far too much energy in maintaining it, and not enough on figuring out what crowds wanted, or how to tailor her speeches so that both laypeople and those in-the-know would get a sense of who she was as a person and leader.\n\nThe end result of the loss can be blamed on the timing of a variety of events and the presence of a variety of scandals, real or imagined, but a large part of the responsibility lies with how she chose to run a data-centric, cold-and-clinical campaign. I hope future leaders learn from her missteps.\n\nAs for her commentary on Obama and her husband...I don't think they ran anywhere near as clinically as she believes. I do think they were more capable of being a visionary, of matching personalities with their opponents."
0,Here's the Bernie Sanders convo from 1 year that Vox did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5vOKKMipSA. Still waiting on Trump's one
1,"Hillary isn't too mad about what happened in the end, because deep down she knows she won and that Kobach et al stole it for the Republicans. Even Trump didn't even expect to win."
-1,"Number one on the agenda, for both the Democratic and Republican parties, should be to slow down the death-spiral of rising healthcare costs.\n\nNo plan, not Obamacare nor a Trumpcare plan will ever be feasible if these prices outpace GDP growth."
-1,I gave the Clinton Foundation a million dollars and all I got for it was her book. I hate it when I don't get the correct change back.
-1,**Vox is Liberal Propaganda** HILLARY FOR PRISON! 1 LIKE ON THIS COMMENT EQUALS 1 VOTE FOR HER TO GO TO PRISON!!
1,HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH

0,"I'm a simple man. I see Hillary's face, I drop a dislike and leave."
1,"I wonder if McCain and Romney would have gotten this much attention if they had written a why I lost book. Wait, they have class so they wouldn't have published a book in the first place"
1,"Hillary saying democrats don't control the media. Lol! Yes, democrats control the mainstream media but nobody believes or takes them seriously anymore."
-1,"Pathetic piece by loser Ezra. She's a corrupt corporate Democrat willing to trample on progressives to further her right-wing agenda. She's pro-war, oil, and pharma. What's the point of this interview? She's already pointed the finger at everyone else for her embarrassing loss. Stop giving her airtime and Ezra- grow a pair and stop being a wide eyed fanboy"
1,She has a public and a private belief system. If you believe anything out of this woman's mouth you are willfully ignorant or absolutely dense.
1,"I've had the bizarre luck to come across both candidates in NYC. One had a huge entourage and didn't look anyone in the eye. The other took a moment to shake my hand, see ME, and ask about my life. Which was which do you think?"

-1,It may not look that bad in Florida but the Caribbean islands are the ones that got hit the most
1,"What a lot of people don't realize is that even though it didn't completely obliterate Florida, there are many of the islands like the Bahamas and various other places that will never ever be the same again. This storm was a monster, but we're only focused on what it did to one place and not the rest."
1,Boohoo shpw the Caribbean. It's gone. Not all this happy white suburban homes without roofs. People in st marteen don't have roofs anymore either... OR HOMES
1,So where are the fly overs of Bermuda?
1,Hi! Check out my channel for tv reviews and recommendations. Thanks :D
-1,"I am so sick of people saying not that bad,not everyone is rich or can afford to rebuild."
1,Try to use appropriate adjectives to describe events rather than over exaggerating to get views like a below average YouTube editor....
-1,"It wasn't that bad in parts of Florida ,but it hit the Carribean horribly"
-1,a horrible attempt to try and get us to freak out
-1,"You know, spotlight should be shown where the hurricane was actually catastrophic: down in the Island Nations. Place where there is no more infrastructure anymore. Where people can't find food anymore because of the hurricane. Not where someone's boat is half sunken or a roof was torn off and that's it."
-1,So some trailers were missing some roofs and that's it? Wheres the flattened buildings or flooded city streets?
-1,Why are they only showing mobile homes?\nAren't they less likely to go through a big storm like this?
-1,This isn’t bad at all... if you wanna see bad then look at the Caribbean islands where it looks like Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.
-1,From the air USA Today posts fake news.
1,That was not shit
1,"I don't see how you can call it not bad when millions of people are without power and they are not going to have food or gasoline for a long time without having to resort to emergency support. Many of the homes are not going to be able to be rebuilt for years if at all and the property will be sold to the highest bidder and they will not rent to these people who are not able to live in their homes now. Supplies go to the richest people who can afford to rebuild and or live somewhere else while they are waiting for their homes. They are going to be waiting for insurance for homes, cars and boats. They are not going to be working for quite a while now. They are not going to be ok in a week. Many have no air conditioning now in the heat. This was not a weak 🌀. There are sick, elderly and disabled people trying to manage right now and figure out how to get by with the devestation. Weak 🌀, I don't think so"
0,Wouldn't call this catastrophic
0,All those Mullets.  Oh the horror.  The horror.
1,Trailer park videos! Really? That's normal.
-1,It's not that bad
-1,"Lool. If you call this bad then that's nothing. Seriously these look right next to the ocean too. Trailer park looked decent. Did you plan the before and after, common? You can't call this catastrophic"
1,"They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep"
-1,*BUT DID IT DESTROY A GAMING CHAIR*
-1,this is one of the worst videos I've ever seen
1,why is it all mobile homes on cement slabs and tin roof panel houses? of course these types of structures would break easy.
-1,Lol!!! A few cardboard box houses were blown away.... devastating
-1,"First off. This was sad in comparison to Andrew. Second, WHO FILMS DRONE SHOTS IN 1x1?! It looks terrible."
0,They gassed this hurricane up like it was bouta be the end of florida. The News Hyping it up like florida wasnt going to be on the map anymore
1,"lmfao at anyone who thought this was actually gonna devastate anything. Florida experiences hurricanes quite frequently. As a result, most houses are built to last through a hurricane of substantial power. The media definitely overplayed this one lol"
0,Has everyone forgot bout hurricane Harvey victims and are worried bout just Florida....?
-1,Catastrophic? Sit down.
1,"We don't care about mobile homes. Show us more of regular houses, that's what's interesting because everyone knows a mobile home can't hold up to a hurricane."
-1,Remember to pay your climate change dues so this shit won't happen anymore.
0,When you get click-baited by the news 😂
-1,bahahaha what's with all that saturation with before irma show us the real pics and don't make it too exaggerated yeesh
-1,Its nit that bad from what i see
-1,It was a CAT 3 at landfall and quickly weakened soon after made worse only by the fact that many a moron live in aluminum boxes. Are those things even anchored beyond electric & gas connectors?
-1,Looks like a trailer park in texas after a small tornado.
-1,Had to stop it 5 seconds in because of the music. Fail
0,Stop making houses out of cardboard
0,We will rebuild we always do...LOVE TEXAS & FLORIDA 👍
1,Never thought people would argue over who's city got destroyed the most.
-1,OH MY GOD!!! THE WORST STORM EVER SLIGHTLY DAMAGED SOME PROPERTIES! CALL FEMA! \n\nWhat is Florida's death toll again?
1,Hurricane Andrew literally flattened entire suburbs. This is far far from a catastrophe.
-1,It really wasn't as bad as it could be.
1,"And the wolf went to the fourth little pig, who made his mobile home out of cheap materials and paper mache ......."
-1,Irma kicked the shit out of those trailer parks.
0,It's almost like Andrew.
1,For a category 3 hurricane it's pretty okay
-1,Lmfao people are disappointed that is wasn't worse wtf is wrong with you people
1,media trying to stir up more fear
0,Make your houses out of stone you will feel like nothing ever happened
0,I don't believe it
-1,"Trump is in trouble, he has to donate 2 million dollars now. He's going to be broke"
1,Woow! So much for catastrophic damages. Even the trailer parks are still standing! 😂😂😂
-1,Whats with the horrible music? tf
-1,"Other then some property damage and laying tress, irma did nothing"
1,Thank you God that I did not get hit and my family in Florida is fine. God bless all the people that got hit. I wish the best for you
-1,👍 Thumbs up if you were expecting a creepy clown with this music.   🤡
-1,Building codes in Florida should make structure more wind resistant. But to me it looks corners were cute. And i cant feel sorry for people live in mobil homes next to the shore in hurricane alley (Florida). Thats just stupid.
1,Really f#ck these square video's. Smartphone manufacturers: Here's bigger screen with higher resolution than ever! Facebook: Here is a square compressed to death video! Enjoy! 
1,"I've lived in Florida- Miami, Melbourne, & Jacksonville- and the strangest universal truth becomes obvious after hurricanes: there are a LOT of trailer parks in Florida on some very high-dollar property. And even stranger is that these people will all rebuild in the same place, over and over again. It never ceases to amaze me that someone would want to live in such a flimsy homes knowing that they're going to see severe storms every few years."
0,what about mexico and cuba?
0,i dont think it caused a lot of damage.
-1,"Houston got it bad, Florida came out not that bad"
0,"This is like a picnic in the park with Elmo. Anybody see damage in the Caribbean, Cuba, and the FL Keys."
-1,THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.  COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.
0,"Y'all acting like Irma didn't hit the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Smh. It did damage plenty and it may not have damaged Florida on a massive scale but thank goodness for that."
1,Show the carribeans! That's real catastrophe!
-1,They hyped this storm up to be absolutely devastating when it hit Florida but it was no where near that...smh
0,Meanwhile Barbuda got wiped off the planet ....
-1,"I like how they're only covering Florida but not the Carribean that got fucked by the strongest hurricane to be ever formed in the Atlantic at its strongest point (190 MPH Winds and 225 MPH Gusts) that even caused places like Barbuda to be Inhabitable (meaning you're not allowed to live there anymore) which the entirety of that island got 95-100% destroyed. And the dozens that also died throughout there. They didn't even cover Puerto Rico, which the US owns. Like shit..."
1,Irma: It's over! I have the high ground!
0,Why not just go to the islands that actually got hit with cat 5 winds
-1,Irma wasn't that bad..
-1,Quit overhyping it. Andrew was worse.
0,https://youtu.be/wJBBlntDtEU

0,"THATS NOTHING, DENIED!"
1,lol nothing
1,this has to be the most clickbait fraudulent claim of destruction I've ever seen. small tornadoes will do 10x the amount of damage this did. who's agenda are you fulfilling usa today???

1,I was doing my natural makeup for work then saw this video and now my look is fall😍😂
-1,"Girl, don't leave me hangin. What was the fail foundation?"
1,As a guy this much makeup is a huge turn off. Just look at her shoulders and then her face she looks off. This is the type of girl you give a hug at a party and then look down at your new shirt ruined and caked in makeup. \nNatural beauty over fake any day. \nJust my opinion as a 22 year old.

-1,Airbrushing -> Unnatural beauty standards -> Social pressures -> Expectations of excessive makeup -> Youtube makeup tutorials -> Ubiquity of excessive makeup -> Ubiquity of skin problems -> Rampant disease -> Zombie apocalypse -> End of human race as we know it
1,I wish berry and darker lipstick looks good on me. It makes me look pale and way too gothy just unflattering on me. Hopefully I find my go to fall berry and brown colors

-1,You're pathetic if u can't go a few days w/o a phone
1,"I don't use my phone to run away from myself, I use it so I don't have to interact with others lol"
1,Very nice message & some awesome animation & narration to go a long with it. Yeah this is a topic I think about a lot. In fact I made a little satire series called Strange Stories to kind of poke fun at how we function with all this advanced technology now.
1,I love that this is posted on the day iPhone X's premiere was released. XD
1,"Enjoy your freedom of thought before our phones literally become a part of us. I can see it now, silent obedience with just the snap of a finger."

0,I have no friends
0,Aha! Releasing this on the same day the iPhone X/8 were announced? You dogs!
1,"this is an amazing video, the animation is great and you actually say some interesting things.\n\nmemento mori"
-1,problem isn't with phones but with ourselves. \nlike hello....move your ass a little around!!
-1,"We spend too much time with our phones, why we should talk to other people in real life, if we could spent our whole life to stare on our phone? (I'm guilty too in this case, so please don't judge me!) ^^"
0,capitalism and materialism are the problems
-1,"My break from my phone is photography... granted, I listen to music via my phone, but at least I'm not still staring at it... and fuck off if you say my cameras a screen, I spend much more time looking around and through the view finder than at the screen"
-1,why did this video take such a dark turn... didnt expect a video about phones to be so morbid
1,"can you the same things for books, youtube, knowledgable video ? plz explain . . . where the scattered knowledge come from . . . what is the right path to become knowledgable without addiction"
1,"I think in the future we will(or should) have classes in school that teach kids the pitfalls of technology and how to stay balanced with one's self in the information age.\nI for one make an active effort to keep balance in my life, even though I love technology and actually work with computers and phones(or maybe because of it). But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy."

1,Anyone ever been to Lyon here ?! :)
-1,"I've had a GSM in the 90's, hated it and never got a mobile phone again, smart or otherwise. What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple.."
1,That was a load of pseudo-intellectual babble.. Far below the standards I've gotten to used to expecting from this channel. \nShame.
0,i managed to watch 1/3 of this before checking my email
1,"This video sounds warm and believable, but in fact, it is wrong.\n\nBecause the problem is not with our phones, instead, it's with us.\n\nIt is like saying the problem with knifes: then, you say that it kill. While it does not kill, but it can be used to kill, also, it can be used for many purposes."
1,"Oh the irony since I'm watching this on my phone, probably more than 2/3rds or the comment section."
-1,1:10 - Scary how this described my current problem at the moment.
1,Tl;dr: get off your phone because it's apparently blocking us from some kind of utopian future even though most of you are watching this on your phone\n\n\n\nI don't get it
-1,"I'm having a hard time putting my finger on this one but something about the videos produced by these guys rubs me the wrong but I can not seem to articulate it.  But, I am getting the sense that I'm being preached to and I feel that many of the ideas that are being asserted should be debated.  Perhaps that is the point of the videos.....  at least I hope that is."
1,"Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access. Or it can be used as a crutch where you can't even think for yourself and rely on social media as a way to feel apart of something. We can't blame the corporations for profiting off the ignorance of the masses, thats just how human nature is. Its the job of people to elevate their own consciousness to become self aware enough to determine a life they want to live."

0,"Same thing as blaming the gun for the murder.  The phone isn't the problem, you are.  If you decide to use your phone to look at pornography all day, that's your choice.  If you decide to use your phone to connect with your grandmother thousands of miles away, that's your choice.  If you can't learn to use the tool you have in your pocket in moderation, that's your choice."

-1,"I do not own a phone. I was asked what the time was once, by this human girl person, and I said; I don't know, because I didn't know. The human girl person asked me if I didn't have a phone on me. I said no, because I didn't. She glared at me like I was personally insulting her by trying to fool her into thinking I had no phone.\n But yeah, I guess I can understand her mistrust...everyone nowadays has a phone..."

-1,"I have my phone on me but rarely get a call. Or text. Somewhat feel I need it on me but on occasions I leave behind.  I want technology to aid my life, get something from it rather than pointless time wasting."
-1,"Listen to Arcade Fire's Everything Now album. We're addicted to this instant gratification our phones provide us. The more readily available something is, the less we value it. It's a dangerous game, and I think people need to wake up soon."
1,"42 second's in Nope this doesn't apply to me at all, I can quite happily live without my phone, its only use is to keep family/friends in contact other than that its not important to me, So nice generalizations at the start of the video"
1,"phone is like a kitchen knife, we can use for cooking or we can use for murder someone, the first thing we should to know is understanding about a phone itself and ourselves."

-1,This guy's voice haha what the fuck
-1,"I like the critique of smart-phones, but found this imagined future technology worse. Let's admit now what the ancient Greeks knew and told in their myths (and here we can include too the ancient Indians, Chinese and Japanese who knew and told likewise): often technologies and machines are just bad."
1,I got rid of my social media and cut my cable off but now I just watch youtube constantly. I have to get a hobby or more of a social life so I can cut it out all together.

But no matter how smart technology gets, it will only ever be a tool, not a guardian angel."

1,"We stand in the shoulders of giants... And through my phone and the information age I can see everywhere... I am an introvert who hates small talk, my world has grown significantly... Its not your phone, but how you use it... Ironically I used my phone to watch this video..."
1,"I have been working on trying to stay away from my phone for useless things and trying to focus and be more productive. Self-awareness and being present are two of the most crucial elements of humanity that we need to start practising once again. Btw, this is quite possibly one of the most wonderful videos I've watched and the writing is remarkable!!"
1,"Well I just realized this few days ago, I'm someone who spends A Lot of time on phone, and it's kind of scary that no matter how much time I spend, I'll never be able to watch all the watch laters or getting information about the subject I want because it is infinite, humans tend to look for happiness and phone help us get rid of sadness or in forgetting sadness, but I certainly realized I'm not talking to myself and it really bother me so I'm trying but certainly we need something more advanced because now you can get so much information with the phone that we can never review it."

Sitting in a room letting your thoughts flow to simultaneously the past and future, feeling at the same time pain, desire, regret and excitement all at the same time. The Mean is to be in a room just watching. Being in the moment not pretending your in the past or future. I mean why were those emotions chosen? every emotion is surely a part of life but thoughts of desire, pain and regret do not seem great to me. It's videos like this that let me know some part of the world wants to lead somewhere sad."

1,"Jokes are cool and all, but there's a dangerous line to tread when you invite the perpetrator of misinformation join in.  This was a fun idea, but you don't get to invite your famous friends on and make them the good guy because they can joke about it.  If she was truly sincere, she would apologize and stop this nonsense. But instead, you gave us the PR stunt/commercial.  Do better."
-1,There are some truth to her methods like cupping and steam. When we are sick we turn on the shower and we use steam. but stones curing you is NOT TRUE. Smelling stuff won't cure fertility. AND she is probably overpricing these methods.
0,Make no mistake: Gwyneth is a snakeoil salesman.
-1,All I know is...gwenyth is fucking fire in that dress...reminds me of being young and dating an aspiring mode...going to work in the daytime then getting off and driving an hour to see her and she'd be wearing some shit like that...makes me wanna use my dick as a knife and stab through that stupid dress and nail her muscular ass so hard she gets whiplash....fucking hot ass bitch...she needs it...I need it..I'm a man...she's goddamn hot...i dont care if it's that dress or not she's gonna get something so hard and long over and over the dmv is gonna shut down cause it feels dumb....have you ever seen two feet spread so far apart you think they might not be attached to a human body? Well you're gonna when I crack them puppies wide and start laying into that vag like its zaxbys special sauce..dipping and dippin then drinking it in....then I'm gonna order some more when I say..UNh uh....don't you even think about flipping over! But that's not gonna happen...her eyes are gonna be rolled back in her head so far she'll be seeing the northern lights as I stroke and stroke and stroke and stroke until my legs give out and I collapse onto the floor and cry like a baby begging for her to get up and climb down off the chair and ride me like evel kenevil flying over some cars until she crashes into the pile of me below...sweat pouring off her sharp chin...hair falling around my face....i drink her sweat and run my hands up her hard abs as she's bending and crushing my tower like penis on her every stroke like she's some kind of shined hillbilly playing a saw at the county fair..I feel it bend and spring out inside her actually hitting her uterus as she stretches upward moaning the hot sweat of the night air and open windows rolling on her body filling my belly button like I've spilled my silky seed on it...as she climaxes she starts speaking in some foreign language which I later find out is the mental limit between the physical and the ethereal and she explodes in orgasm so hard she turns in to a mid air splash of pure Florida orange juice and I'm left lying in my tight blue Levi's with no shirt on in my trailer and I wake up and realize I'm just drunk and hallucinating but there is orange juice everywhere....and maybe she was there...and maybe she wasn't....but I'm thankful for my vintage heather blue Levi's orange tab boot cut vintage jeans...if I hadn't had them on with a thick leather belt...I might've put a hole in my trailer wall....all I'm saying...is that gwenyth Paltrow....in this one second I'm seeing you...you make me wanna tear you apart...I'm not saying you're beautiful or ugly or pretty or nice...I don't know what it is...but...you got what this man needs....that's all I'm saying. (Not to blow you up but...hey Margo stilley! Remember that night you came down? Yeah well I had to insert gwenyth Paltrow into it because she's fucking exploder right here...I know you were the one in the dress when I met you and it was silver not gold and you're not gwenyth Paltrow but...if I could get a hold of gwenyth Paltrow right now...well..I damn sure wouldn't be saying hi to you...you snotty evasive tart...)
1,DAMN! She looks like a Playboy Playmate! Never saw her so hot hot HOT! WOo HOo!
-1,"This goop crap should be illegal. And, shame on Gwyneth for using her celebrity status to promote such ridiculous pseudoscience."
1,"I think Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty hot, like most straight guys probably do, but to promote her BS lifestyle magazine / whatever is reprehensible. GOOP basically takes advantage of misinformed people, that spend money they don't have to buy things they don't need, don't work, may be harmful, and are overpriced, because they somehow trust Paltrow for advice. Some examples of snake oil scams promoted recently by the magazine: 1. Wellness stickers from NASA that were publicly discredited by NASA, which confirmed the product has no technology developed by NASA in it. 2. Yoni Jade Eggs, which women are supposed to put inside their vaginas, which in the words of OB-GYN Dr. Gunter could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome; and 3. Vaginal Steaming which doctors also call a load of garbage. Just to name a few. They have been repeatedly knocked for false advertising, misleading advertising, and settled lawsuits out of court. It is truly horrifying to see CBS promoting this garbage. I hope CBS is named in future lawsuits that are sure to come as people are injured and/or simply realize they were duped by Paltrow and GOOP."

1,This foundation made your skin look flawless and so healthy! This one is a keeper
1,I can't wrap my head around the fact that such high price foundation doesn't have a pump. For that money you should definitely get a pump!
1,Day 11 already! Love your videos.
1,The liquid Lottie London foundation I heard is much better!
1,I would love to see you review the Dior Forever foundation. I think since you have issues with longevity.. this one could work for you :)
-1,I have been on acutaine for a few months now and I went from having extremely oily skin with cystic acne to a few regular blemishes here and there (still not done with taking the pills) but my face is so dry now! I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though!
1,"Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything)."

-1,Your skin looks bad. I would NOT put ANYTHING on it. Eat pineapple and get some SUN! It will help kill the the acne causing bacteria and smooth your skin out. Fresh cut pineapple every other day for two weeks. And no makeup for two weeks.\n\nStart with that and you will need a lot less foundation!!
1,"Your videos are often the best part of my day! So glad that even though your audience grows and you are so busy outside youtube, your spark, humor and dedication to making quality content never fade <3"
1,You are very honest and I love that about your channel. Keepem comin

1,I kinda like the way you look better with medium coverage. It makes your skin look more natural I think.
1,the stick foundation looked drier than the sahara desert. wow.
-1,That's so weird (the Lottie foundation) cause I have both of there's. The stick foundation is one of my favourite foundations plus it covers a lot! \n\nThough I do have fairly unblemished skin.
1,Really hope you'll be reviewing the new peach foundation from Too Faced!

1,"Hey boo! Love your videos and so happy this foundation worked for you, I can't wait to try it out! Just one recommendation- the title is slightly misleading, because it said fail in the beginning I assumed that the Estee Lauder foundation was the fail and I almost didn't take the time to watch the video. But once again, love your videos and I'm absolutely loving 15 days of foundation <3"

I thought it showed off her texture way too much and her skin looked uneven in color and it also made her pores show so much more with this foundation. I've seen plenty other foundations you tried look absolutely beautiful.on your skin but this one for me didn't do it for you ."

1,"Kristen Bell is really a demon succubus from the fourth layer of hell. She's actually there eating old people, no one notices a few missing old people in a hurricane. Her cover as a beautiful, talented, classy lady is a charade, and when she collects the last of the Black Rings of Raziel, she will open up a portal to the depths and unleash Armageddon. Only Craig Ferguson and his side kick John Cena, can stop her now... Geoff the Wizard of bones predicted this while drinking with me one night."
1,She should definitely go to 'The Good Place' now 😇
0,Kristen is bae.
-1,Sometimes I think YouTube should get rid of the dislike button...\n...I'm guessing that at least 107 people thus far would give me a thumbs down for saying that.

1,Looks like a cheap watch for kids.
-1,"Frankly, why can't Apple come up with better form factors for the watch?  Why does it have to look so effeminate and generic that is so bland and boring?  Seems the place (Apple) is run by engineers.  None of the products raise any heartbeats.  One would expect more from the richest company in the world!"
1,It will be nice if it was a standalone device with its own App Store and wireless headphones included.

It's a damn watch, so buy the watch cuz it's fast then buy iPhone 4 just to make calls? Until there is something significant that the series 2 watch can't do, then it's a waist of $$$$$."
1,"Im really for it, it really depends on how much it will cost monthly. It better not be any more than 10 dollars"

1,"Please know that JESUS LOVES YOU, JESUS IS LORD, AND JESUS FORGIVES. We are all sinners. We are all on our way to hell, forever. God does NOT want us to end up in hell, a place of eternal, conscious torment and suffering (Not parties). We can all live in eternal paradise with no pain and no suffering forever. It’s one place or the other. Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’ Jesus took our punishment for our sins. This is a FREE gift. Many will never know how wonderful a relationship with Jesus is because they are afraid to ask. Try asking. What do you have to lose? Just ask Jesus into your heart and to forgive your sins. It literally costs you nothing, but will give you everything. God Bless."

1,I love this finally real deal w step by step thank You much love a solution to having power at the back of the property for cutting back wood sucker trees
0,Well done! Where are the batteries from?
0,Where is link to podcast  interview w/ Jason regarding solar power?  You mentioned this around 5:45
1,Looks nice and like the solar idea. In my opinion having a shop at home . White interior will be difficult to keep clean.
1,"Very inspiring, keep it going.\n\nLove it!"
1,And I notice that there are free range chickens in this video.
1,I guess the only issue is getting enough power to handle a light welder. Otherwise it pretty awesome.
0,So can I  borrow ALL the people who helped you build yours?😊😉
1,"12:53 - Amazing shed, but looks like you had to settle for a cheap Pabst after spending so much on the shed."
-1,"All that sand, gravel, tamping .. seems like a waste?  since installers propped it up on 8 shimmed pads around the outside edge .. the gravel there will wash out over time and/or ground will heave.  Some 3' post holes and 4x4 pressure treated posts would last for decades, and remain level .. and eliminated the ugly shim pads."
1,first time i watch one of your videos but it's really great I'll check out what else you got on your channel
1,"Great video , and nice work ! Going to share this video\nWith all my buddies ! thanks"
1,Awesome!! I love the wall storage system! Looks better than standard pegboard for the large things! Nice work!
-1,I want this so bad!!!!!
1,Wouldn't it be better to charge the batteries before the inverter so it doesn't have two times the loss when changed to AC than back to DC  for charging again?
1,About the ground rod: you can protect it using a piece of pvc tube with cape to be a little prettier and safe
1,Lots of great ideas!!
1,its nice to see that your chickens help you pack down the dirt
1,Awesome!!! Please do more videos like this one!!
1,how to build the second storage with such material when first story is built on solid concrete??
1,Love your work! Do you need any assistant? Please let me know.
1,"Great video, the editing and narrative was amazing and the project was awesome"
0,Did anyone else catch the brand of all the tools and lawn equipment? Don't recall it being mentioned.
0,Need this to get away from my wife. A foldable bed off the wall and im sold
1,I enjoyed your commercial. Now off to home Depot and buy some Ryobi products.
1,OK I'm sitting down how much did this cost in total
-1,Those dirty hand tools are going to rust out there.
1,this video is so satisfying :) i didnt fast forward a single time!!!
1,Wow i Love it! Subscribing now!
1,This video was AMAZING! tks for the content! This channel is GREAT!

1,Should have added a vacuum air duct system. Good build tho so jealous
0,Everything was from home depot  even the tools was this sponsored?
1,good Idea BUT as its a SPONSORED video The cost outways the build or Ideas unless youve got the Cash

1,it seems like solar panels will be exposed to sun only half of a light day.\nflat roof or 90 degree turn of a shed would make whole thing more effective.

1,Why do you only own ryobi tools?
0,YES. This is so gooood

1,"Despite what she said, I must say that I am thankful for what the United States has done for Puerto Rico. Despite President Trump's narcissism, he has greatly contributed to the betterment and recoupment of the island. It makes me sad to see how Samantha Bee doesn't mention Trump's actions to temporarily lift the Jones Act and the help the United States is sending. I must say Good bless the USA because without them, I would not know how my family is doing right now. I am thankful to be part of this great nation and proud to have voted for the current president of the United States. Maybe we'll even get statehood during Trump's presidency!"

1,"ah Puerto Rico it's in the middle of Pacific Ocean , this guy just making so much \nexcuses. yes we now that .and there's human in the Island."
1,"How is this stooge trending. St3even Crowder has a domestic terrorist infiltration with just as many views, but that's not trending?"
-1,This video proves that female liberals are terrible with memes and political jokes.  The canned laughter is cringe worthy.
-1,Puerto Rico is just some useless territory we picked up that is in so much debt we should just let it sink to the bottom of the ocean.
1,More liberal propaganda! Where was Obama back then during the hurricanes? Golfing like a the great divider that he is!
1,Folks..this here has got to be the DUMBEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME. I would laugh but it pains me he's THE USA'S SH*TBAG OF A LEADER.
1,"Hillary had to tell Trump he could send the USS Comfort.  Maybe she could also remind Trump he's got a Navy with aircraft carriers with a few helicopters he could send.  The port of LA, Oakland, etc. has no shortage of truck drivers who could use a nice paying temporary govt contract and would love to take a quick trip to help move trucks around and operate equipment on Puerto Rico.  Maybe Hillary should let him know that too?"
0,"I like how Colbert, Myers, *and* Samantha Bee are all on trending on the same day. Coincidence?"

0,The construction of your pile of nachos was euphoric to watch
0,"I am not vegan, but I eat a lot of Vegan food, and those Nachos were the truth. Would eat those without worrying about meat any day."
1,"I like your recipies, i´d love to try the vegan nacho cheese, on the other hand, i would like you to know some things becuase those are not mexican dishes, those are TEXMEX. We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalapeño, but thats ok. \n\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\n\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \n\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it."
1,Absolutely love that you guys are making more plant-based dishes on Brothers Green! The vegans and animals are thanking you both 😄

1,"Why do you put gluten free and vegan together?\nIt's not by choice that we don't eat gluten, we're just super sick when we do."
1,"Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\n\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods."
1,Love it! More vegan vids!!
1,"This video is amazing, really inspired me to give some effort to make a dinner like this some point in the future when the moment arrives. Love it!"

1,Help!   Any help confirming what type of non stick pans you and your brother use?  In need of a new decent one.
1,Am I  missing something? I'm not seeing the actual recipes anywhere? I'm SO glad to see you started a vegan channel!! When I first ran across your videos I thought it was a vegan channel and was sad when I realized it wasn't so this made my day!

1,The Perfect Complement...so delicious...I would love to see an ingredient list? I don't know what I have on hand and what I would need? can I gather it all in 1 week? I think first and foremost I will try NACHOS! Gonna be S.O. G.O.O.D! Great Ideas!!! ; )

1,"I have had a can of jack fruit for a year, but none of the bbq recipes look good to me.  This one you did looks amazing, it's got the look of what I love.  Thanks!! I subscribed to your new channel nut you are not on my feed, weird."
1,"When I see Jackfruit in the grocery store I'm intimidated by the size of it. I'm single/live by myself, so I don't usually buy stuff like that unless I really like it and will eat it right away or can preserve it by freezing it. Can someone make the Jackfruit meat in this video and store (by freezing) for later use? I saw another video on the munchies YouTube channel where a guy made a BBQ vegan sandwich out of smoked trumpet or king oyster mushrooms. I'm highly intrigued by it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIpdhlVZY&t=75s"
1,Fantastic! Thank you
0,What happened with meat
1,"Thank you so much for posting this video! I have just begun my transition to vegan eating, primarily for health and ecological reasons, so this is perfectly timed for me. I also appreciate that you're mostly using ingredients I can find near me--I live in a very rural area, with a single grocery store in town. If I want more exotic ingredients, I have to drive about 30-45 mins. To give you and idea of how limited our selections can be, we just started having avacados here as a regular item maybe a year ago. :/ I have never seen jackfruit in person, but I will make an effort to check for it the next time I do an out-of-town grocery run. If that fails, there is always The Interwebs. :) Thanks again, and congrats on the new channel!"
1,How long does the vegan cheese and sour cream last in the fridge? Can I freeze either? Would love to make in large batches so I can save time/money
1,Making my MMA debut next Saturday. My dream is to become world champion. Follow my journey much love
1,"OMG that all looks amazing. Especially the Jackfruit tacos. I am extremely allergic to poultry, eggs, feathers.....the whole nine yards. we are fortunate to live on a farm, so mainly everything comes straight from the Animal or the ground here (with a few exceptions, lol). My husband says we do not do vegan but I so could. I am going to try to trick him with this. Yumm"
0,This is a crime against mexican gastronomy
0,If there ain’t meat it ain’t Mexican
1,Thank you for this! Jackie is awesome sauce and I can't wait to make some of this.
1,Hey where do you guys get permission to use those songs from sound cloud? I'm really tired of the YouTube royalty free tunes. Thanks!
1,"I really do not like Vegan food and straight plant based recipes but, I respect other people's choices! Rad video, as per uge! You guys are awesome together. 😊"
1,"Absolutely love this video! Just wanted to add in that Diaya while it is vegan they just switched over and sold out to a company that tests on animals! Just wanted to let you guys know because I know it bothered me when I found out, I didn't know if Jackie is aware of this! But there's so many other vegan cheeses which are even better than Diaya in my opinion like Follow Your Heart and Chao!"
-1,"The problem here is that vegan food is way too expensive, produce is absurdly priced in most places, especially avocados, and cashews are expensive too. Meat is and always will be cheaper."
0,"I remember the times when the food recipes included some meat. Nothing against vegans, but I didn't think this channel would turn towards vegan foods as often as it does."

0,i cant wait 4 the album!!!
1,"I've been hitting replay because I'm trying to understand why this arrangement and style. IMO it's very un-P!nk (to put it kindly). But I never ever thought of P!nk to be someone without brains, so I stuck around longer and kept hitting replay. \n\nI continued scrolling the comments to see if I'm the only one who went WTF (especially after the verse, and even more so at the repeats of 'my love my love'), and then it struck me--IT'S FOR RADIO lmao gotta be similar to all the other trash out there so the majority of people will listen to it, enjoy it (because it's something they're used to), look her up and listen to the rest of her songs. 😂 \n\nI hope I'm right, because GENIUS! Lol"
1,Pink can give any artist a run for their money.  What a beautiful talent

1,I understand everything but my dad dont speak english and i rly want to see this short film with him together. Warner can you make german subtitles ? Thanks :)
-1,Make this a series and I'll watch the fuck out of it. Anything Watanabe gets his hands on is a masterpiece.
-1,"Was pretty awful to be honest, although I can see how all the normalfags will eat this shit up as it is all style no substance. I really hope the movie isn't like this or it will go down as one of the worst sequels ever I fear."
0,I could've watched another hour of that...
1,I NEED MORE OF THIS !!!!
0,This quality animation can't be beat.
1,I am 5 minutes in and I would sell my soul to the devil if this would turn into an actual series!\nAnd usually I'm not that much into anime at all.
1,"Great video. I just wished this was captioned for the Deaf and hard of hearing to enjoy. Otherwise, the visuals were amazing."
1,"The creator of Cowboy Bebop, recognized the moves ;)"
1,"I really feel so bad for this Trixie replicant,the way she looked at the flying dove before dying was so beautiful, it reminded me of Roy Batty. i feel a  Pris Stratton resemblance with her."
0,This should be a Netflix series.
1,"I'll watch Blade Runner 2049, for better or worse."
0,Any word on whether the score for this'll be released or not?
0,This is basically Animatrix: The Second Renaissance
1,I want a full movie of this or series
1,Nice that you got Edward James Olmos back for a few lines!!
-1,Im not sure an EMP in one place could affect the whole world since earth is generating a magnetic field.\nOr maybe flipping the magnetic field could do it.
1,Nice little nod to Star Wars @ 9:24 with the soldier's uniforms! I am so pumped for 2049!
0,So... is Iggy the founder of the Wallace Corp.? Or is Wallace Jared Leto's character in 2049?
0,Guess we know what happened to Gaff.
0,If anyone knows the song at the end let me know thank you
1,I saw the original Blade Runner at the theater when it came out.  Maybe the best SciFi film of all time.  We are now living in a time when we need to be paying attention to the real shit that is going down in this current society and be prepared for a real EMP that will certainly take down the grid for a LONG time.
1,Well that was interesting. Good animation though.
1,It would be incredible if we had a full length anime.
1,I uploaded a video essay on the new film and the director for anyone interested
1,Can we get more please!
1,"I’m not an anime fan, but this is really well done! One issue though- the replicants are banned on Earth, so why are they being put into the Earth market? That detail triggers me so much lol. Plus, in the 2036 clip, aren’t those supposed to be the Nexus 8 replicants? Hella confused by the contradictions here"

0,for fans of Blade Runner : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRp1kofoo88
1,"Why does the voice acting still sound like a low end dub? this was made for warner brothers, so presumably it was conceived by Watanabe originally in english. \nI get that people in the US see that as a stylistic mark in japanese animation, but I can't stand it. I would have preferred japanese audio and subtitles if they were going for a stylistic imitation, and it would have fit nicely with the cityspeak language of the original film."
0,I think the blackout hints why Ryan Gosling shows up at the deserted area in the trailer of 2049 where Harrison Ford finds him. It's the same city.
0,So Star Wars rebel soldiers are guarding the facility at 9:27 ?
0,Can I ask for the ending song names?
-1,"if we die do we go to heaven?\nthere is no heaven or hell for us, this world is all we've got\n:("
1,Anyone else notice that 6:45 looks like the Scott Free  animation for Ridley Scott's productions?
1,youre more human than human.........perfect spot for some rob zombie:)
1,4:12 we need translation... any hungarians here ;)
0,Reminds me of _The Second Renaissance_ from _The Animatrix._
1,zzzz...only really impressive for people who haven't seen god anime.
-1,Almost every line spoken was terrible. Might've been better with even less dialogue.
0,What's the name of the song while the fighting scene?
1,This is beautiful stuff... Wantanabe is just a genius
1,Blade Runner would make such an amazing anime
-1,"Ok these replicants need to stop doing backflips, you can't dodge bullets using backflips. This ain't fucking Matrix!"
1,Wow the cityscape scene at 3:42 is just breathtaking - for a second they make this dystopian future look incredible
0,Why couldn't this be an actual anime series!?
1,This is such beautiful art.
1,is this just me or the ending song is actually good?
1,I hope that in the future could ever be a Cowboy Bebop live action movie directed by Villeneuve.
-1,The end song whats its name i have been searching for an hour :(
1,Remove that crappy song at the end and this would be perfect.
1,"Awesome i loved the acrobatic bits espesh! \n\nAll those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die..."
-1,Could you please ADD some fucking SUBS??\nSpanish and English please...
1,Now I have to watch Blade Runner. This was amazing
1,Cannot wait for the two others! This is really good!
-1,A pity that Blade Runner 2049 is coming out the same year as the masterpiece  “First they killed my father” or it would sweep the Oscars.
1,Legendary. Can't believe how good Blade runner 2049 is gonna be
0,Why is that doll Annabelle?
1,"Very good, thank you all involved."
0,How could you dislike this?? How??
0,that truck looks like the back part of akira bike
1,GOOD\nbut the first 2 shorts were much better IMHO
-1,i fear those shorts are not better than the movie
1,"Damn, now I want more from Shinichiro Watanabe."
-1,IF ANIME HAD THE SAME HOLLYWOOD FUNDING THIS SHIT HAS OH MY LORD.

1,"Wow,Its thanks to this anime that I noticed the replicants in the original film have a red glow in their eyes upon rewatching it."
-1,I really hope they are not pulling an Alien Covenant type of crap with these shorts.
1,Were we supposed to like or care about these characters in anyway. It honestly just made me hate replicants more than anything considering they just killed hundreds to thousands of innocents.
0,Subtitles???????
0,I hope the disjoined nonsense plot isn't canon to Blade Runner 2049.
1,"Lots of scenes copied from the original - the acrobat, the glass. I imagine if people have the time they could match more, and more.  Not really a great!  3/10 as just some interesting fight scenes\n\nNo back-story or character development.\nBackgrounds and scenes copied from the original, more than a few times - cheap, cheap!\nSlight plot change the blow up something\nDialogue - corny,  More human, than human\nSeems like it goes some political angst written in somewhere, but I was so bored couldn't be bothered to engage or think about it?\n\n\nTell me if you watch it ten times if it is great!!!!! \n\nWill delete in 5 minutes, boring!!!!!!!"
1,"If the new Blade Runner is only half as good as the animated short, it will still be mind blowing amazing! Can't wait for it!"
0,Does anyone know an anime with a similar art style ? Movie or series
0,Song?
0,Anybody know that song at the end of this clip?
1,looks fantastic! I really enjoyed watching you create it too.
1,You would be my favorite writer if you ever wrote a book.
1,"I have to say it...I love your work, John, but the first time I saw your video I was shocked and thought at first you're kind of creepy. That's just because you are so different, so refreshing and you have something special in yourself. And you make me feel addicted to watching you, I don't know why. The more I watch you, the more I'm fascinated about your personality, as if you were an old soul like me. I also absolutely love the tone of your voice, as well as the vocabulary.

1,"You have an artist's eye! I'm a graphic designer and I'm really enjoying how you use color, gradient and lighting in a way that compliments the curvature of facial features. I always know when I have a great design when I can't stop looking at it. I feel like you've accomplished that feeling with this tutorial. I would really enjoy it if you shared more of these editorial and artistic looks with us. They are very amazing and show us the power of makeup in a way that isn't being portrayed on YouTube."

1,"Neither of those attempts were valid, though... you didn't conform to all of the rules. In the first attempt, you didn't say your DraftKings username or #DraftKingsPizzaChallenge (rule 2), and in the second attempt, you again failed to do both those things and your timer was not in clear visibility during the video (rule 2 and rule 4). Then again, being a sponsored video probably made you well more than $100, so I guess you didn't need to win the challenge anyway."

-1,Poor little Megyn. She can't hold a conversation. Why in the world does anyone think she can handle this sort of interview? So embarrassing.
1,"It's inevitable, she's going to be kicked off. NBC, just save the time & money and do it now. She's nothing special and was only popular because Trump talked about her vaginal blood."
-1,megyn is just so awkward.
-1,Megyn Kelly sucks on morning tv.  Who asks about plastic surgery during an interview about a movie.  Her “gotcha” style interviews sucks and hurts the TODAY show brand. Stars are going to start boycotting appearances because of her
1,Really!??? That's what you're asking? Such a waste of time... can i ask you something Megan? Can you leave!? right now!
-1,Megyn Kelly is horrible! I would never watch her show after seeing this!
-1,Kelly is not a people person and has zero charisma. This interview is so awkward.
1,"So ageist, so sexist. this was criiiiiiiiiiinge lol"
0,cringe interview
-1,Omg that question to Jane Fonda was so inappropriate and ill timed! Horrible horrible horrible! Megan is so bad at this job it's startling.
0,Megyn should quit this job....its just not for her....shes off topic
1,"I can't believe MK had two of the greatest actors sitting right in front of her and decides to discuss plastic surgery! REALLY??? She's blowing her chances, you can't teach humility. Crash and burn..........."
1,Megyn Kelly is the worst. How is it possible to be so thoughtless? Jane Fonda and Robert Redford are amazing and I wish she could have asked relevant questions. #losthope
-1,The interviewer couldn't make it more awkward for these legends with her imbecilic questions
-1,"Is MK interested in anything  besides appearances and age????? How shallow! (and that's a kindness!)\nwhatever made someone hire her in this capacity ??? nearly brainless. And the audience as well, WHY would they populate the seats for a program like this?"
-1,Megan: Lose the f**king pen! IT's stupid
1,"Megyn says it's a beautiful, beautiful film @ 5:00 and it sounds so disingenuous, she probably didn't even see it!!"
1,Did anyone else feel like the question was really inappropriate? About plastic surgery? I mean really?
-1,Queen Jane shoots down the vile Megyn Kelly. Take this witch back to the slime bucket that is Fox News.
1,LOL.. the fail is strong with this narcissistic blonde twit.
-1,"I thought she said Arseholes at Night ! ( it's the American accent, I'm a Brit)  Terrible interviewer and possibly the most insulting dumbest cringeworthy ageist questions she could ask ... these two legends. And yet they were still gracious . Wish someone would give them the time they deserve and a respectful interviewer"
1,"Jane Fonda got more class, brains and beauty today and always, than that intervier Megyn Kelly has.\nThe way Jane Fonda handled that interview was amazing considering it was a full on nasty cut-throat remark by Megyn Kelly.\nI'm with Jane Fonda all the way, and Robert Redford. Just amazing talented people."
1,I love how people their age don't give a f and say things the way they are. Lol
-1,Megyn just doesn't have a clue.....smh. She's not going to be accepted by anyone before too long.
0,MEGAN KELLY TONIGHT!\nLAST SHOW\nCANCELLED AFTER 1 WEEK\nDUE TO VERY LOW REVIEWS
0,Jane Fonda did a wonderful job after that terrible question
1,megyn kelly really sucks...more and more...pretty amazing redford's gone from media recluse to showing up on day time chat shows...getting older made even the sundance kid come in from the cold...
0,Megyn Kelly is AWEFUL.
-1,Horrible interview.
-1,1:51 Really Megan Kelly That like Bryanstars level of Stupid questions i mean come on.
-1,The only thing Megyn has going for her is her looks. She is terrible at interviewing. That is why her show is tanking.
1,"it's amazing how when you only see a short clip about the plastic surgeon question, an impression is left with the viewer how inappropriate the situation was and how angry Jane Fonda was. However, when you watch the entire interview, it was really only a blink in the context of it all."
1,"The only way a Megyn Kelly talk show could be anywhere near remotely entertaining  is if it involved her stripping down and showing off those floppy, whithered, 46 year old fun bags.\nREPLY"
-1,"man, do they live in the past or what?"
1,Redford has become so effeminate.   He has been a good actor and last saw him in A WALK IN THE WOODS  with Nick Nolte in 2015.
0,MK just can't stay in the moments.... interrogate off topic vs. appreciate now
1,hahHHA I AGED NORMALLY BUT ALSO HIT THEM INJECTIONS HAHA XD IM GOOD ACTOR
-1,Megyn Kelly screwed up here.  But sometimes I get the feeling these liberal celebrities try to throw her off balance on purpose because of the fact that she came from Fox News (which they absolutely hate).
1,Megyn Kelley like most conservatives and Fox News anchors are tone deaf and just completely ignorant.
-1,You know that something is seriously wrong with today's society when someone like Megyn Kelly is a somebody.
-1,MK is not for daytime TV - she does not relate - she is a hard news person
0,I  would spit on Hanoi Jane heifer dog
-1,Her show appeals to idiots. That's all
-1,What a hack job Kelly did on both of them ... yuck!  no more Meghan Kelly
1,"I think Jane looks great, nothing to be ashamed of. What's her surgeons name, lots of woman have had surgery and look it, jane looks pretty natural."
1,I just heard the next episode is going to be completely devoted to DIY tips to protect your family from the New Black Panther Party. You're doing gods' work Megyn!
0,She destroyed her career when she left fox...today show screwed themselves after paying millions for her😂😂 instant buyers remorse
-1,She is trying its hard to overcome old habits fox news was and is the worst
-1,"women have nothing to offer other than their looks. they are all terrified of aging, its sweet justice for us men who have to watch them entitled and evil all their life"
0,Please come back to Houston
0,It’s over Johnny
0,"MK sorry, but can you drool over Redford even more?"
-1,Totally shocked by Megyn Kelly's announcement at 4.57.  It sounds like she is saying 'Arseholes at night'! Better to emphasise the second word ( 'Souls' ) instead of the first ('Our').
1,"Jane was looking daggers at Megyn and rightly so.  Megyn was extremely rude, would she want to be asked about her hair extensions?   I've always liked Jane Fonda and am glad to see her and Redford together again in a sequel of sorts to Barefoot in the Park.  I don't recognize that electric horseman movie because it was so awful."
1,"Almost every question had to do with age.  WTF!?  When the interviewees keep having to save the interview, you know that something's JUST NOT RIGHT.   Redford's right about Jane, she's amazing."
-1,I feel bad for Fonda. She had to sit through an interview with this ignorant woman.
0,Age!!Age!!!looks!! AGE!LOOKS! MK IS OVER
1,"Kelly is great...who doesn't love watching a clown, just waiting for the fool to show up."
-1,never has there been two ego maniacs like Megyn Kelly and Jane Hanoi Jane Fonda pompous arrogant complete drones .  Redford that ship has come and sailed but still hanging on for some publicity and to be adored by the public.  PATHETIC !!!!!
0,Megyn Kelly already reached her peak of fame. It's all downhill from here.
0,i came here for Robert & Jane\n& then i saw  the cow\non the presidential debate \nit is her ?
0,Miss Kelly should just get off TV!!!!!
-1,Megyn Kelly is no OPRAH. WHY is she so obsessed with Jane’s looks and body -_- she’s so fake. Trying to force feed us superficiality. She is spearheading ageism by constantly talking about Jane’s looks.
1,"Megyn is forced and beating to her own drum at the expense of Fonda here. And also, why didn´t you ask Redford about his facelifts? Probably had as many as Jane has. Be a little self-critical about how you reproduce old stereotypes of women by the questions you ask. Not cool, sorry."
1,First the Will and Grace Snafu. Now this.\nYikes.
0,Cringing in embarrassment for Megyn. Why not askJane who she's looking forward to working with on the next project? Jane has class for miles!
1,Jane and Robert came to promote their new movie and Megyn consistently tried to take the conversation to any other topic besides the movie.  Strange way to do a movie-promo interview.  I can see why Jane was annoyed.  And Megyn still didn't take a hint.  She's got a big learning curve on how to do this kind of show.
-1,"Can't stand Megan Kelly, what a horrible interview"
-1,Awful host! She don't know how to listen to her guests...
-1,Isn't this Megyn Kelly that person who claim that Jesus Christ was white and should only be showed as white? Isn't she the one who makes all types of excuses for police shooting of unharmed black people and claims that it has nothing to do with race.
1,"Wow, they are still alive."

1,It seems like when you're older your age will be rubbed in your face whether it's in a form of compliments or not...Honestly it doesn't need to be constantly pointed out 🙄
1,"Jane is funny.  She definitely likes to be the centre of attention with discussion pertaining to her or her co-star referencing her or them, even at her age.   Robert Redford has a good sense of humour."
-1,"She is a racist and a liar. I will never forget how you purposely inspired racist attacks with race baiting, calling black protesters thugs, saying that all Muslims are terrorists and  inciting people to commit hate crimes all over this nation. You and the rest of the propagandist at fox, both past and present, are covered in blood from all of the attacks and murders caused by your words. You cant hide from your past and who you really are. NBC are trying to normalize these people but DON'T LET THEM. DON'T WATCH ANY SHOW KELLY OR ANYONE WHO THINKS LIKE HER IS ON. SHAME!!!!!!"
-1,"Jane Fonda just through complete shade...NAHH ..., she threw ABSOLUTE DARKNESS on this ignorant, moron, lawyer turned news anchor, turned entertainment host. Meghan,,dear,,,, CATS are the only creatures to boast about 9 lives, your DONE."
0,This dyed-blonde skank must be deported to Saudi Arabia ASAP.
1,"I personally think MK did a great job, and I’m not even a fan."
-1,Megyn Kelly will never be half the woman Jane Fonda is.  Not to mention the Integrity.
-1,I think people or the media are making too big of a deal out of this part of the interview. Now that Ive seen it it just wasn't that bad.

-1,"very wicked evil man, he caused so many people to fall into sin because of his iconic sinful influence, the devil was and still is his father even in death. hes now reaping what he sowed now, hugh hefner is merely a proverb for mankind to learn of what NOT to do. its a shame that he chose to throw away his soul and how he lived to continue to not genuinely care for other peoples hearts and souls, not even his own son, he was a bad role model for so many things, he threw away his role as a father, husband and man in general, please learn from this mans selfish way of life, run to Jesus."
-1,It took me a long time to like hugh hefner.
-1,"Well, at least he wasn't a hypocrite. There's more mercy from God for straightforward bad people than for liars and hypocrites. Nevertheless, let's hope he repented at the last, because otherwise there'll be no RIP for poor, pathetic Heff."

1,"“so far so good, no heroin in the dick vein yet...”"
-1,"Juggaloes are nice people, but they are really, really stupid. Seriously, I'm not joking, if you are open minded or a very accepting person. They are seriously lacking in intelligence generally speaking. Just listen to the music. It's unquestionably retarded. No one can or will challenge me on this. I am right. Goodbye retarded but nice juggaloes. Listen to someone smarter than you ."
1,"Honestly It's hypocritical ; they listen to horrorccore  rap which describes beheading people,  stabbing people, collecting heads, and murdering children yet they claim to be the nicest people on earth liker one big family, it's really stupid.half of these motherfuckers are obviously on hard drugs; yeah real great culture to raise your kids in :/. bTW looks like violent Jay lost a lot of weight ;)"
0,Sounds like furries trying to justify their degeneracy.
1,"It's all about love, acceptance, and family. Their Family.  I know some juggalos and I'm different from them and they ignore me or call me names for not agreeing with everything they do. I'm Disabled so it feels good to be hated for no reason."

1,Most of these people are bullshitting. The gang label is neither here nor there. It is an excuse for publicity and a concert. Which is fine by the way. I can see people had fun.
-1,"whats with your anti trump bullshit, you being a fanboy and saying what you think they want to hear? guess what, cupcake, trump isnt the one trying to deny free speech, the fucking antifa and leftist scum are, and i would think juggalos would be about free speech. Btw i could see how uncomfortable you were around them, maybe you should stick to the suburbs and grab ass with your antifa buddies. lame."

I always praise them for what they have accomplished.  Hustle and flow......minus the flow. They have an incredible work ethic and believe in what their doing.  But juggalos calling the FBI inbred.......C'MON MAN!  If you take half of all the juggalos that gather each year at the festival.  And sign them up with ancestry.com. Id bet they all come from 5 different blood lines MAX.  The ancient Jugalos defs succeeded in keeping that blood line pure.  So much so, that when one hot woman attended the gathering they through their shit on her! (admit it.......tila tequila was once hot)  Inbred see.....inbred do!"

1,"Looks good - nice cast, written and directed by Garland, who made one of my favourite recent sci-fi films in Ex-Machina (which rightly catapulted Alicia Vikander to superstardom).\n\nLet's hope the studio doesn't water everything down into mediocrity like they usually do.\n\nAnyway - I've decided to watch this, so I WON'T be watching the main trailer, because that will obviously spoil everything [you can set your watch to these trailers and predict almost every main event in the movie]"

-1,"In the United accident, they violently dragged a guy off the plane for absolutely no legitimate reason.\nIn this one, they just made a women leave because she is not allowed on the plane. Plus it looked like she was deliberately trying to be difficult.\nIf police get on my plane and want me to leave I would get off the next second without even bothering to ask why before I'm off. A sane person would never be like her in the video."
-1,Very tough to look at that.... I wish the police would grab you like that and force you off the news set for sounding so ignorant and misinformed.
1,If she doesn't have the right paperwork to fly .. why the f is she even on the plane? Doesn't make sense
1,Jesus Christ way to not tell the whole story and Pander to Delta Airlines
0,Nothing to do with allergies. Everything to do with islam. This is what they do.
1,"Shows 45 seconds of an incident and proceeds to paint the criminal as a victim, ignoring the facts that lead up to the altercation. \nThis is a private corporation that has every right to remove people (by force if necessary) just as this ignorant reporter would have the right to request police to remove someone from her front doorstep."
0,Here we go again.

0,"I don't like dogs either, but that's no reason to make a federal case about it."
1,Lol the airline couldn’t risk a death in flight when she’s “deathly allergic” and she’s wouldn’t get off HAHAHAHAH
1,Ok so what are the police supposed to do when they refuse to leave the plane? Ask nicely and if she says no then well better luck next time?

1,"If I was  deadly  allergic to dogs and there were two dogs on the plane  medical papers or not , I would get off that plane as quickly as I can in order to avoid an actual life and death situation.

1,In America a dog's life is worth more than a human life.
-1,Does anyone have a real link to the video... seems odd that she says she could be deathly allergic to animals and still wants to stay on the plane. Paperwork or not she still would be deathly allergic to the dogs. To me this video seems like it was made to make SW look bad. Where is the whole video?
-1,get rid of this stupid background music

0,"as I am someone who has allergies especially to dogs and cats, this woman is a c***. if you know you have allergies you're supposed to have proper documentation. If you don't want to increase your chances of being allergic, maybe try not rubbing on every seat prior to exiting the plane."

0,"They had to, she wouldn't leave."
-1,I though airplane passenger abuse season ended but I guess was wrong to still going will it ever gonna end
-1,"It's disgusting how news reporters can misrepresent a story and make assumptions when they know little to nothing about the actual situation. Based on what I've read, the woman who was removed from the plane was not cooperating with law enforcement. The way the news reporter presented this is that law enforcement is at fault and that the woman removed from the plane is a victim. This is absolutely disgusting abuse of the Free Press. This is also typical of the leftist mainstream media."
0,She's a professor for Islamic studies. Coincidence that she's deathly allergic to dogs?
1,How is she supposed to be removed ? On a golden magic carpet with a orchestra playing a Celine Dion song ? Or how about carried off by a group of nuns while Fabio does her hair ?

1,Austin!! Should of gone with Cryorig H7 Quad Lumi CPU cooler. More aesthetically pleasing and pretty sure it is AMD compatible :D Also handles over-clocking well
1,"Hi, I have been building pc's since I was 9 years old. I would go for a Dell monitor, usually they have really good color accuracy ! Or go with a high end LG monitor. You don't need a 120hz+ for editing. - I normally use my MacBook Pro for work, and my Windows pc for gaming and other stuff that my macbook can't handle, which is pretty much anything besides from youtube and excel, word etc."

1,"Well, just stumbled across this video, since no one really has mentioned too much on monitors, I am a fan of the 4k dell ips displays."
1,Mouse: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APA8D2G/?tag=pcpapi-20 Keyboard:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0164SF9TS/?tag=pcpapi-20Monitor: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017EVR2VM/?tag=pcpapi-20\nMouse should be good for editing. Keyboard is a Cherry MX Silent so (if) you ever game it shouldn’t be noticeable in the audio. The monitor is a 165Hz refresh rate and 16:9 1440p IPS. So you should be good for these.
0,I can see the awkwardness in your eyes.
1,"You should probably get an LG Ultrawide since most of those flagships are made for productivity and video editing, for keyboard and mice, get any mechanical keyboard of your choosing, like corsair or razer ect."
1,Video of this build in action please
1,You so pretty chic Beautiful women ever build pc in youtube😮 😵😍

0,That mobo is a piece of shite. No joke.
1,Logitech MX Master 2 and Craft :)\nScreen 27“ 4K or 34“ ultrawide with 1440p.
1,Monitor Question: Stick with IPS panel for the accurate color. Also don't go any smaller than 27 and if you can find a 100Hz monitor that would be key. Or an IPS Ultra Wide IPS panel with a 3840X1440. Personally I trust Dell monitors and so far I've had good luck with them. my oldest Dell 1080P was bought back in 2006 and it's still working today and I like their contrast ratio and brightness. Just set them both to 100 and good to go. Blacks are black and whites are bright. Also if you don't want a Dell Monitor you can always look into a Samsung or LG or even ASUS. They all make Ultra Wide and once you go there you will never want to go back to 16:9 ratio again.
0,u should get the mx master mouse
1,Hi Sara! My advice would be getting a Logitech or Razer gaming mouse. Or if you want a good wireless mouse for premiere or final cut try getting a Logitech Master or 2s. Thanks for reading this! byeeee
0,TEAR THE PLASTIC SHEET OF THE SIDE PANEL
0,she has no idea what your on about😂
1,Never seen her before but I like her :)\nGreat vid
1,So funny hearing you describe why you switched from EE major to CS because that’s exactly the same reason why I’m studying CS now! Great video BTW
1,"Get a Logitech mx master ii for the mouse, great for editing. And for keyboards, just get something low profile that looks good. A k900 would be a good choice probably. I recommend these parts assuming you're not going to game, although this pc could seriously game."
1,Nice video! but for me there is little problem and that is volume or position of mic. cause Austin is pretty normal but you Sara you are pretty down on volume
1,"Nice collab, in terms of a mouse, you can try the razer naga epic chroma, it is a bit of an expensive one, but a Nice one, if you have a mouse from razer you might want to check their mousemats aswell, to get the best our of your mouse... You might aswell want to consider a headset or keyboard from them... it is worth the money tho"
1,"She´s in it for the money, for sure. Gold digging hard. I hope that Evans is red pilled and goes MGTOW."
1,Get a Logitech mx master for a mouse and grab the new Logitech wireless keyboard
1,Sorry to say this i think Austin really fell for her :p
0,Remove that plastic on the case
1,MX Master mouse is amazing for editing and productivity.
1,"First off, nice collab Sara. The first video I saw of your was how to Casey Vlog and that was great!\n\nFew things I wanted to throw your way about the build. \n\n1. Get an AIO(All in one) liquid cooler for you PC to replace the big heat sync with the brown fans. You have a nice looking case and that cooler for the cpu just ruins the build aesthetic. \n2. Check out cable mod to see if you can get some white and purple cables for your build instead of the plain black ones. Again, aesthetics. :D \n3. Check out the MX Master mouse. The new white one would look sick with your white and Purple PC! \n\nTotally just suggestions! You just got a new subscriber, great video."

1,Foreigners speaking Japanese is so attractive to me
0,I swear I thought this guy was Josh from Just kidding news.
1,"Yeah, I also have the weird issues with no one wanting to sit beside me because I am a foreigner (I thought it was because I smelled different).  Despite that, living in Japan is good and there are a lot of excellent opportunities if you know how to sell yourself. And he's doing a good job of it. \n\nIn the past, there were some other famous black comedians like Bobby and the guy that was really good at singing enka. There are a lot of passing fads and comedians... staying in the limelight is always really hard. \n\nAlso, I have lived here off and on for about 15 years and within the last say 5 years or so there has been a major increase in the number of foreigners and tourists due to the visa restrictions being removed on a lot of Asian countries."
0,日本には肌の色での差別はないです。あるのは、日本人と外国人の区別だけです。\n\n日本のローカルな地方では外国人とコミュニーケーションを取る機会がまだまだ少ないです。なので、外国人はとても珍しいので、見られることはあるでしょう。避けられる事もありますが差別ではなく戸惑いです。それは、言語の問題など含め、コミュニーケーションを取る方法が思いつかないからです。\n日本人は排外的とイメージされますが、外国人が日本に観光に来る事は歓迎をしているのが多数派です。外国人が嫌いと言うことはないのです。\nまして、黒人だからという理由は無いです。\nただ黒人さんは仕事を探して来日する者も多く、より稼ごうと犯罪に絡む場合もあり印象を悪くさせている場合があります。アジア系や中東系も同じです。\n白人系は観光客が大半なので比較的に印象が良いままです。\nそのような印象の差はあると思います。

1,"What they don't tell you is that they make him act dumb all the time, sane with Bobby Olugun, and the other Black famous actors on Japan, to poke fun at Black people so it isn't as good as they make it seem"
1,"Sweet talk, “I don’t think Japanese are racists”. Dream on! Try to settle in Japan outside the world of entertainment ...."
1,"Damn, these Vice reporters know so many languages it blows my mind. I can barely handle one, and they seem to know whatever needs to be spoken."
1,"I wish you could go into even more depth. Double this segment! Maybe Japan is more use to seeing white guys, but over in China that wasn't the case for me. Everyone would stare at me like I'm a walking museum. I would have people ask if they could take a picture with me at least once a week. Mind you, I wasn't living in the big major cities (Bejing, Shanghai, Guangdong). They'd get weirded out even more when I'd start speaking in Mandarin. They'd still try speaking English to me even when I'd respond in Mandarin. I definitely get what he's saying about the 'train thing' and no one sitting next to you. It's a bit weird..."

1,I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn’t have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don’t see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video 😉 https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs

1,Lol.. I bought a $1700 wig from freedom couture and didn't even get a wig cap with it. Beauty bloggers getting more treatment? Hm yeah

1,You guys are both beautiful!!!!
1,You guys need to join Wig Skaters group on Facebook. $1500 is way to much for a wig
1,You get your foundation then flip the wigs and place it on the lace. Braid you real hair to lay flat then use gots to be glued to keep the wig Down or you can sew the wig on
1,I'm a black woman and those wigs looks so natural but 1500 dollars might as well should of tried clip in extensions would of saved some money!!!
1,I'm a guy and even i found this funny to watch.
1,Pia looks like Nina dobrev at certain angles with that wig on!!!
1,As a straight male I watched this to learn for my girlfriend. That is all.
1,"Those wigs are amazing, you guys just don't know how to put them on but it was really funny 😂😂 do more vids together! Maybe watch some black YouTubers, they know the best wig techniques"
1,"This was such a funny and fresh video! Thank you Chloe, nice meeting you Pia! By the way you look Really good with that dark colored wig. I suggest you also check Jackie Aina's video on how to install the wigs. Blessings from Mexico 🇲🇽"

1,You are so funny
-1,"Holy shit, you spent $3000 on wigs she will never wear. Crazy!"
-1,That was Horrible! ! Hahaha
1,you guys should collab more
1,you also have to put make underneath the lace in order to make it more like scalp jajaja its also called bleaching the knots or hiding the knotsss
1,From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything
1,"How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you’re wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you’d leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn’t match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too"
0,😝
0,Pia looks like jhene aiko here
-1,ladies if you buy a wig that expensive you need to get one with bleached knots so you cant tell its lace.
1,Use Bobby pins for the sides but other then that looks good keep on trying 😄
1,"As a black woman who occasionally wears lace front wigs, I agree - when I watched tutorials as a beginner, I realized there are SO MANY STEPS MISSING!! And omg she really used double-sided tape lmbooo poor thing, I'm dying!! lol I recommend getting some wig glue or toupee tape instead of regular double-sided tape (which will shine through). Also, for people with fair skin the lace should be bleached, so it's transparent. The lace on these wigs was like, light brown/tan lol tooo visible for their skin tone... hope it works out better next time :)"
1,Maybe if you learnt the proper application it would look more natural ❤️
1,"Yes I'm so happy, I love pia!!!!! :)"

-1,I'm so picky with wigs like I can't stand fake looking ones but the ones I want like these are too expensive
0,Hey Chloe look up freedom couture hair on YouTube she has heaps of tips and tricks! X
1,Omggg you turn the wig inside out and put your own power foundation on the lace parts
1,"Check out Blondielocks here on you tube.  She is the best at explaining wigs from what to buy, styling a wig and how to make it look less 'wiggy' looking!!"
0,Pia's arms are ripped !!! I wish mine looked like that.
1,The struggle is real! :) I totally understand the confusion. I was clueless when I started wearing wigs years ago. I am still trying to master the lace game! :)
0,"What do I do about that?\nYeah, see, idk... \nMMMMMMEEEEE giving advice"
-1,Gross waste of money. Why people support this company I'll never know.
1,It's better brown on pia
1,It takes practice just like everything else in life. I think you both look awesome and can master the wigs.
-1,"I love how you just casually got freedom couture wigs, I'd give an arm for one, losing all my hair :("
-1,I cant believe they wasted 1500 dollars just to fuck it up.
1,Chloe -- do a video using only products that don't test on animals please.  It would be such a great boost for these companies and you don't have to put down any other company -- just highlight the ones that don't test. Thanks! <3
-1,I totally understand your frustration!! esp with the sides!!! i have a wig that i never use because the lace on the sides is always showing.....and i can never manage to conceal the lace in front either? :(
0,Chloe check out this youtuber's tutorial on wig application\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDLCu-8DXsE
1,"I've been married 16 years. I have a pretty good wife though we've had our problems. Here's why I don't recommend marriage for unmarried men now:\nFirst, the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of failure is too high, unacceptably high. The odds of finding a suitable partner who can and will actually be in it for the long haul are too low.\n\nSecond, marriage for a man means mostly taking on duties and obligations. The offer was sweetened because in exchange for his taking on those obligations, the prospective husband was traditionally promised one real, valuable benefit: Good, regular sex at reasonable intervals with a reasonably attractive women, all with a minimum of effort. But even that's not guaranteed now because many wives do not consider they have any obligation to have sex with their husbands and feel justified in withholding sex for the flimsiest of reasons or no reason at all. And besides, a man who wants sex in this time need not marry to get it. All he needs is either (1) minimal game competence; or (2) money for prostitutes.\n\nSo, if he can't even get some minimal guarantee of the one benefit he's supposed to get out of the deal, why should he even try to make the deal in the first place?\n\nSorry this betrays some of my Christian beliefs. I'm just stating realities on the ground.\n\nWhile women certainly do have feelings, and they sometimes use the word 'love' to describe it- It depends on how we define love.... is it a passionate moment of powerful feeling... or is it a lifetime of commitment and sacrifice?"
1,"Stick with the Jon Renau, and Raquel Welch wigs. The lace front in these wigs are very realistic, no cutting lace as it's already cut.\nGet hand tied as they're much better quality."
1,Oh Chloe! Jackie Aina has a wonderful video on this: https://youtu.be/uDLCu-8DXsE
-1,as a every day wig user this is a huge fail to me but it totally shows that just buying an expensive wig doesn't mean it will look bomb (which is a common mistake ) so thanks
-1,"To get rid of the spotty look you have to put powder foundation under the lace to help cancel out the dark lace roots. Try it next time, that should help. Also, you can cut the part around your ear to contour to the natural curve of your head. So don't be afraid to cut some lace and hair around your ears."
1,Chloe is so beautiful omg💓
0,Girl just chop all that lace off!!! God I just wanted to jump thru the screen and help!😂 watch Nikita Draguns video on how she applies her wigs! It's bomb 🔥
1,"It is quite dissapointing how noticable the lace is on a freedom couture wig.  I was going to save up money for one but the mesh is very spaced out and seems thick, and for that expensive of a wig, you expect to look more natural and seamless. Ive bought 300 dollar wigs with better up close lace than that.  There are ways around it.  I would look up videos to try and cover the mesh.. some people use got2b glue on the inside of the cap and let it dry to cover it up.  Personally I am a silk top girl and if I dont like the lace on the wig that is touching my scalp I put the wig a bit father back to almost see my hairline and I color it with brown eyeshadow powder.  Hard to explain but it looks a lot more natural.   You should also put Freedom Couture in your title so more people can see it.  I know I am glad to have found your video before purchasing.  Thank you for the honest review.  Your wig is workable though so don't worry!"
1,"the pieces near your ears that you were struggling with, i've seen people use double sided tape on their face and like stick it down and it works and also gives you a nice little face lift"
0,ur supposed to cut the lace around wig
1,I've seen great tutorials from black women who basically wear wigs 24/7 and they glue the lace to their own hairline and it looks flawless.
0,She looks like the chick from Glee.  Santana.
1,those wigs would look so good if u knew how to properly wear then 😭😭
-1,The girl with the blonde hair looks like jhene aiko. The other one looks like Kendall Jenner.
1,There are so insanely amazing wigs out there! Look up Diniwigs online or insta!
1,Tip! If you plan on wearing the wig with the cap try picking up a dark coloured wig cap so it doesn't show through the wig! Light coloured caps work better with light coloured wigs so it doesn't look like weird patches :) also netted caps are a lot more comfy than stocking caps!
0,Chloeeeee you look like Kendall jennerrrrr
1,To ware a wig you should shave you head smooth to ware a wig .Otherwise if got hair leave a loan.say no to wigs .
-1,It actually looks terrible I think these are the worst wigs I've seen 😮
1,This was so entertaining 😂\nJust use clip extensions. Haha
1,It's cute that you guys don't know about wigs. Tip: please don't use that tape. It will pull your hairline out. Put the wig slightly behind your hairline and bobby pin the sides.
-1,Chloe! Watch a tutorial of a black girl doing it..!!!! They are the pros at it
1,I watched a couple of front lace wig videos and some of the ones I watched the people cut the lace off before they put on the wig and I think that would be much easier and you could get some of the side bit of mesh/lace.
-1,Dumb white girls
1,I think the girl with brown hair could bear me a fine son.
1,Hahaha loved this! Some people do glue it down :) and makeup would help but cut it where you can still see it! Xx

1,Neat and amazing makeover in only $300 but what about your fees?
1,Good taste and creativity can make a thrift store decor look like 5 star hotel!
1,"Don't like.  The picture for the headboard is small and doesn't feel balanced  on a wall by itself.  Too many knick knacks.  The dresser knobs are too big for the piece and should be painted a different color.  Choose a metallic but not gold and silver together. The canvas picture, I'm not even sure what the point was.  I think you could have done better shopping a few thrift stores for more choices."
1,"Been following you on and off.\n\nAs a teen with a tiny, awkwardly designed bedroom and a necessity for large furniture (see stacked bookcase), which makes it hard to express my style - minimalist black/white/grey/gold contemporary/modern/rustic/retro, and attempting to keep costs very low, i would love to see you do a similar challenge, as many decorators do not think about the functionality and practicality of spaces, which is needed in small rooms that have to serve many functions."

-1,"He DEMORALIZED and brainwashed thousands of people, according to his own account slept with over 1,000 of women treating them like a SEX TOYS, created a BUNNIE image out of woman's body in his SICK PERVERTED HEAD.

1,So far it's been good 2 years. Lets hope other degenerate celebrities and politicians will join him soon.
1,I'm sure he died of aids after all the whores he allegedly was with!
1,"Good riddance.  This PREDATOR started the visual publication of pornography, which in-turn created other competitive brands (hustler, penthouse, club, etc) and so forth.  The publication and availability of this illicit material caused infidelity, hedonism, debauchery, etc.  Some of the most notorious serial killers have attributed pornography as the root for their killings.  Pornography is destructive and it affects people in different ways just like alcohol would.  Hopefully Hugh repented before his last breath."

0,He's in Hell.

1,He was a pedofile and a pervert lol I'm not gonna shed too many tears
1,I wonder if he lamented all the families he destroyed with pornography on his death bed.  I'm truly glad this monster is dead.
1,He won’t be banging any hot ladies in hell. He better have repented.
-1,"Finally this playboy muppet is gone goddamit....RIP Mr.Playboy! old man sucks by the way, i am really happy about his death, ugly skinny cunt he was i believe!

1,"For anyone judging him and saying this man is rotting in hell while qouting the Bible. You truly learned nothing from the good book didn't you? Yeah can spout how he sinned and all that but that's not the point. The point is don't pretend to be holyier than thou when your all busy codemning and judging. Oh here's a Bible qoute for good measure.\nMatthew 7:1-3King James Version (KJV)\n\n7 Judge not, that ye be not judged.\n\n2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n\n3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"

1,I dont understand why people are saying they are glad he is dead...or that he should rot in hell
0,I thought he'd die of STD.
1,"Disgusting man, he will most likely burn in Hell. He had 91 (pretty sure) years to turn his life around and repent, but not a single damn regret. He used women for his own pleasure and made them look like objects and people are praising a man of such indecency. Filthy"
1,He looked good for 91

Lots of people criticized his lifestyle having lots of girlfriends and sexual partners some actually thought he'd get infected with HIV/AIDS by sleeping with every new Playboy Bunny that walks into his mansion. He starred as a cameo in Hop and The House Bunny with Anna Faris. The people attending his funeral will be his children,his third wife,Brande,Holly and Kendra"

0,Should have punched the bitch in the face
1,"This is an excellent example of how using a bs excuse- to impose personal preference on other people- can backfire. Many comments are about the ‘allergic’ woman having a cultural allergy. Granted, it is a well known and common cultural ‘norm’ within Islamic and other Asian societies to behave/react/treat animals in a manner that is vastly different from the cultural ‘norms’ in America. Especially, where dogs are concerned. Many Americans accept/love/treat dogs as family members and revere their service abilities. Socially/culturally, the U.S. has enacted laws surrounding service animals. Keeping in mind ‘norms’ aren’t necessarily followed by everyone in/of their culture.... this woman’s actions and behaviors substantially reflect her agreement with cultural bias more so than concern for a physiological allergic reaction. A human being that has a physiological allergic reaction to dogs would- 1) make necessary arrangements while booking the flight, and 2) would immediately remove themselves from an environment where potential of an allergic reaction that could easily lead to death was highly probable. Further, they would do so without force and without attempting to justify their perspective relative to personal academic accomplishments/occupation."

She had no right to insist that the airline staff administer a shot to her right on the scene, something which is not captured by this video.  I feel sorry for all the other people on the flight who were delayed by this nutcase.  It blows me away that people still think they can behave this way in airports, on airplanes, etc."

And as such, by law, they have the right to refuse service to anyone, at any time, for any reason. They can say whatever they like as to why, and you can bet it will be something that covers their ass just fine. Like they felt she was a security risk or something. So its goodbye, you stupid retarded bitch. I just wish the cops would have tazed her and dragged her out so they didn't have to struggle so much."

1,I'm on a work trip in Toledo right now..
1,"This wouldn't happen.\nThe reason why taxes are hard to file is because there's a lot of deductions and benefits we can take.\nIf we opt for a hassle-free filing system, people pay more taxes. The good news is that it benefits society and infrastructure, bad news is that we're overpaying.\nAlso other items like losses/business failures, you get a tax deduction. The government wouldn't take their time to find out how much you can pay less.\nThe IRS audits 2% of the 300 million population every year. We all play the IRS lottery to not get picked. \nWhen someone's tax form gets picked and is incorrect, IRS resubmits the form as quickly as possible (without any tax benefits). \nOne of the problems they check is the income. Did you record ALL income: gambling, stock dividends, lottery, tips, etc.\nFor those who are lazy, Turbo Tax is a great program to file taxes."

1,Neither move matters. Warriors still winning it all. No one else is even close.
1,"I don't understand Max's thoughts here. Just look at how the players were acquired. Wade was gotten for absolutely nothing. Carmelo still got the Knicks back assets. It's clear that despite Wade having a better career than Melo so far, Melo is worth more than Wade now. Melo is more than 2 years younger, better perimeter shooter, and Melo is an above average starting PF while Wade is a below average starter at this point."
1,"Wade is coming to a situation in Cleveland where on paper he shouldn't be needed as much with the roster they have, but let's face it he will be.  He will probably play a lot, if for any reason because of the Lebron / Wade chemistry.  I don't think IT will play much because of his hip, Rose nor Calderon will be a factor, there gonna need Wade big time.  I agree with Max here because Wade's addition will definitely put Cleveland in the finals and in my opinion give them a better chance at winning the finals also.  Whereas without him and no more moves by Cleveland I think Boston would have made it.  OKC would have made it further than the first round with the addition  of Paul George alone.  Now with Carmelo they might make it to the Western Conference Finals but they still will not get by the Warriors.  So basically Wade = Ring, Melo = 0."

(smh, Melo means more to OKC to get from 1st round to the WCF, as opposed to Wade who give you a chance to actually compete against the GSW at the Shooting Guard position in the NBA Finals for the ultimate goal which is an NBA Championship)... pfff, lol... Steve. A doesn't know SHIT"
1,Cavs much deeper than the warriors. Bench Is a starting 5.
-1,Okc with pg and Westbrook were a lock for the 2nd round if not the conference finals. With melo they have an outside chance against the warriors
1,"Anyway, the Thunder are not gonna make the West Finals with THAT bench. You think the Spurs, T-Wolves, Rockets, and the Warriors are gonna let up? If all teams are healthy, the Thunder has the least possible chance of winning the title. Kawhi is a one-man megastar with an excellent back-up team, CP3 and Harden both have excellent court vision and efficiency, The T-Wolves trio have a better bench, and the Warriors are too solid a team to just be beaten by 3 stars with no back-up. Even the Celtics with Kyrie, Hayward, and Horford have a better team than them."
1,The Cavs roster looks better than the Warriors roster. Even last season. The Cavs should've won based on the players they had. They had 9 players on their team who were drafted in the top ten of their respective drafts. Look at the warriors roster besides their big 4 lol. How did the Warriors win?
1,"melo is a bigger pick up for sure, stephen A is right and Melo is just better than D wade at this point in their careers"
-1,nba is so fuck up
1,I  find it funny that yall think these two old horses could actually make a difference especially against golden state 😂😂😂
0,we gonna get 3 rings n a row the cavs team 🔥
-1,Boston's ancillary pieces contain a number of untested and/or ascending front half 1st round picks.  Some of those guys are going t blossom Max.
1,Melo by far he's stillness hungry for a ring and still has a couple good years and a potential 1 or 2 great years
0,"Max proved Steve's point, yet his pride would not allow him to admit it."
0,when i read the title i swear i knew it was gonna get heated
-1,What  pointless debate. This is cancer. Go for a walk outside
-1,Seriously? Wade is cashed out. Can't play a full schedule or 30 mins. How is this a discussion? Boston has no shot? Hahaha. No more basketball talk for ol Maxy
-1,"Stephen A is overrating Melo, his offense is still great but his D is horrible, and people tend to deny that Westbrook is also a bad defender (not that he doesn't have the size or ability, it's just that most of the time he doesn't put enough effort into defense, and don't say it's because he doesn't have teammates and needs to carry the team on offense, even when KD and Ibaka were there, his D was still bad), so you got 2 bad defenders on the starting 5, imo OKC won't even reach the WCF if they face the Warriors or Spurs in the 2nd round."
-1,I hope the celtics make the finals Im tired of the cavs and gsw warriors highjacking so much talent .
1,Melo but both are great picks. Although the Lebron - Wade combo is pretty nasty
1,"Definitely melo, not really a question. Wade isn't the same as he was 5 years ago. Melo is, he just hasn't been utilized in New York."
-1,"These two douchebags don't know a fucking thing! Worthless losers! I hate them both, they're opinions are worth dick...I hate their voices, attitudes, and ugly ass faces. I'm so sick of these two assholes. ESPN used to be so awesome... Then they became political...WTF?!?!? I want SPORTS NEWS, that's it!!! I don't fucking want or need racial diversity in your sportscasters... Period. You either know it or don't. Get rid of these cancerous idiots. I want to punch them both in their fucking face. Over and over and over. They should have a vocal box, teeth or lips. They've abused that God given gift! #axKellerman/chokeSmith... rinse and repeat!!!"
1,Delonte West to go to cavs would have been funny
1,"If Cavs still had irving and wade was abit younger I would say this would be the best time ever, better than the current warriors"
0,Okc is just hyped. Gsw is still the team in the west
1,This weirdo max said need him for what?? To win a ring duhhh
1,"Most valuable pick up....\n\nJae Crowder by the Cavs.\nEFG% - 57.2%\nDefensive Field Goal Percentage - 41.9%\n\nMakes the Cavs more efficient on the Offensive side, and more effective on the Defensive side. Great pick up. Cavs only behind Golden State and Rockets. Now better than Spurs."
1,good take Steven A
1,Carmelo he can play 3 or 4 plus he can be a threat still inside and out. Love wade doe
1,LMFAOOOO IM SO HIGH RN I JIUST REALIZED THIS NIGGA MAX KELLERMAN SAID NOTHING USEFUL AT ALL TOOK A FAT L
1,Boston has no shot?! You look like the guy that misses all your daughters dance recitals because you're too busy cheating on your wife with your peeing BDSM leper. My prediction is that you will have NO SHOT at getting your family back! *Swish* muthafucka lol
-1,"Im so tired of this lebron excuses nonsense. The warriors are stacked to the point of being unfair. Lebron was LAME in the 2011 finals, but never again has that happened and it sounds fucking stupid to try and stain the record of the second best player ever. Its not going to work he is already there, he aint going nowhere"
1,"Wade isn't as good as Melo anymore, plus OKC needed another superstar so they could add Patterson to the bench to make it superb. Wade is a huge pickup for Cleveland mainly because of him being 5x better than Smith and Shumpert combined, but he can't shoot and might be only an average defender now (when he tries). But the good thing is now the Cavs can use Shumpert in a trade probably including Love and the Nets pick for another superstar or 2 all stars."
0,Max is just a joke
1,"O we beating the Warriors. 3 guys who can shoot IT, Love, LeBron"
1,I thought it said who has a bigger pick up like melo really like full size truck like a tundra while d wade has a midzise tacoma
0,Don't count out the wolves in the west..
0,Stephen A. got this one.
1,for those who may be concerned or would like to know how molly looks when sitting on my face .. stop the video at 0:17.. your welcome lol
0,Who cares. The Warriors are gettin that ring again.
0,"Wade, carmelo is a ball jog, how the hell can he play with Westbrook when kevin Durant couldn't?"
1,OKC were still going to 2nd round with pG13 .. Maybe even WCF but Melo does not make the much of a difference .. He just adds a bit more offence to a team that's it ... And he can't play defence or pass or move without the ball .. Nor does he have a inside game .. He is a shooter for OKC ... That's it
1,"If Melo can play to his strengths I agree with Stephen A. If Melo plays like he always has I agree with Max. Melo has to get to that damn corner where his efficiency goes way up. He should get open looks with George and Westbrook driving, and Adams crashing the glass. Melo needs to become a spot up shooter and drive when it's there. If I was coaching Melo I would say, no holding onto the ball unless its 5 seconds or less on the shot clock. Only then should you be creating your own shot, this goes for George too. Westbrook can dominate the ball and utilize the weapons around him, which are much better then last year.\n\nI don't see this happening though lol. Melo and George have to adapt to a completely new role, which I don't see going well. OKC finishes 4th. Wins first round, and loses second round."
1,"Stephen a acting like melo a superstar 😂😂 he's good offensively but he's no james harden, steph curry, klay Thompson"
1,"Melo is over rated and Steven ass loves the taste of those chocolate balls, lol"
-1,Is it bad that I read the title “who has a bigger dick”...?
1,wow. I'll have to actually side with Stephen A today
0,Carmelo's a ball hog
0,"Melo gives OKC firepoer that could match Warriors, Spurs, Houston offense a big three of russ, PG13, and Melo seems almost undefendable"
1,Did he just say the rockets are better than OKC 😭😂 He love the cavs
-1,"No more excuse for Lebron ,any way is goint loss in the West ."
-1,I've never seen max lose a debate so badly.
1,"I agree with Max Kellerman. Truthfully because of Dwayne Wade. The Cavaliers are a completely better team. Dwayne can bring the ball up as a point guard and pass accordingly. He actually had some big Alley oop passes back when LeBron played for the Heat. If that type of play comes to the Cavs, it will be a huge influence on the whole team. On the other hand idk if OKC is capable as of now, based on chemistry. They also don't have much of a solid bench. That brings me to the Cavs who are better overall based on the chemistry Dwayne Wade will bring. If I.T. heals back to original state he can contribute tremendously and he will have much defensive help; on or off the bench."
1,Did Stephen A just win a debate? Is this a fake video?
1,"Wade a better pickup. He can score, defend, block, pass, and make clutch shots when needed."
1,"Carmelo can't shoot worth a lick and has been washed up for the past 7 years.  D Wade is good and solid, but he's past his prime and won't bring anything tangible to the table."
1,"OKC will get to the conference finals MAYBE. They have two very good scorers and melo is great but not as good compared, anyways, but the rockets i feel have a way better team overall. OKC has a terrible roster other than the big three, don’t even lie ! they’re trash, they should make moves for more depth. But the spurs and rockets are probably still better than OKC IMO"

-1,Hands down Wade. I seriously can't believe people are actually thinking this is close. Wade is a complete player. Who terrorises you when you're at your best. A proven nba champion. And just a few months ago was balling in the playoffs with a shit bulls team. Melo is a proven scorer. But I'm still not sold on him as a big time playoffs player. Let's not forget when he left the nuggets for gallinari_ the nuggets finished 3rd that year. He goes to knicks and just fades away. All while supposedly in his peak.\n\nWade will beast till he retires. Might play a few less games here and there. But thats it.

-1,"i  know you dont do tv series, but if you do, please sin ghost whisperer. and just to make it easier i have listed 5 things i hate about the series.\n \n1- the main character (melinda). the biggest cry baby, for a tough character she sure cries alot. i swear if i had a dollar for every episodes she cried i'd be a millionaire by now. i mean she meets dead people all the time she should get used to it by now. she is always the center of attention, her ghosts are more important than anyone else, yes that bothers me to no end. and call me a feminist or whatever, but having her showing her cleavage in EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE. can get very distracting, very annoying very fast. i mean if that's what it takes to get ratings then that is just pathetic. i swear most of the time she goes to work in her night gown i can see her cleavage. what also annoys me is that she keeps talking in that whispering-about to faint voice. speaking of fainting, she does that alot, just asking for more attention.\n\n2-  (jim) the husband. i feel like the show made up a fantasy fictional husband that just wont work in real life. that's jim. he cooks, he cleans and melinda on the other hand wakes up at 3 am night to go search for her ghosts in the streets while leaving her husband to worry. she does that like more than once. there is an episode where she gets stuck inside a cave and jim has to look for her and when he finds her she bursts out crying like a fucking baby that she is and he just calms her down. now if that was in real life he'd be yelling at her not to run off in the middle of the night like a lunatic. or he could just divorce her on the spot. he told her many times that these ghost business should wait because he wants to spend more time with her but she is like nope, the ghosts are no.1. accept me for who i am. fucking selfish hoebag. i never saw this woman do any wife duties. i never saw her cook or clean, its always the husband. and before anyone jumps in again and says i am sexist, jim works in the paramedic and was a firefighter before. he runs around saving people. both his jobs puts huge muscle strain on him. yet we see him at home cooking like he wasnt even tired at all. in real life husbands would just remove their shoes and fall on the couch sleeping. all melinda does is stand in one spot selling or running off leaving the work to someone else while she chases her ghosts or drinks coffee. there are many times he rings her to see if she is ok and she is like sorry jim then hangs up. one time her husband told her off becasue it got too dangerous but she yelled at him saying stuff like don't tell me what to do i've got to save those ghosts!. and when he wanted to become a doctor and study outside of grandview (he was also trying to get her to stay away from danger), but she snapped at him saying what about me and my life and my store. she is fucking selfish. she is a bad wife. period.\n\n3- all fathers are bad, all mothers are saints. there are many times were some ghost fathers who did wrong but they arent bad themselves, but melinda treats them like criminals because she keeps seeing her father in them. for a gift like that she sure knows how to abuse it and the ghosts. there is even one episode in christmas, where the a father was talking to his ex-wife about her affair with another man and the son might not be his, the wife snapped at him saying i cant believe you'd actually do a paternity test!. well, it's HIS FUCKING RIGHT TO KNOW IF HIS SON IS HIS OR NOT. fucking whore. and i swear to god, i knew i saw it coming, he receives the test results by mail and melinda ACTUALLY convinces him to accept his child even if it's not his because it christmas the season of forgiving. and he tears the letter! i literally screamed at the tv and hit my fist so hard it hurt. in what justice do you treat your husband like that? the wife goes fucking around and then carries a bastard that has a huge risk its not the father and the father has to forgive the wife??!! NO FUCK THAT YOU FUCKING WHORE. FUCK YOU MELINDA. and also the episode where the college teacher payne knew his ghost wife was cheating with someone else and melinda AGAIN asks him to forgive his wife just so she could go to the light but he refuses (having every right to do so) but the ghost just backfires at him. \n\n4- everyone in grandview is rude. i dont know why they do that. is it to scare me not to visit grandview or just to make melinda look more like an angel? but i have seen this more than once. every one she meets and their first words to her are who are you? what do you want? excuse me? they all look at her antagonizingly. there is even one episode where she wants to sells some stuff and the receptionist looks at her from bottom to top with the biggest attitude i've ever seen. and its not like she meets her again, no, this is like a one time encounter in the whole freakin series. it makes no sense and it makes me NOT want to live in grandview.\n\n5- there is no judgment, everyone goes to the light. yes including killers, rapists, wrongdoers, whores, liars, thieves, criminals, kidnappers, Sociopaths etc.\n\ni'd rather watch supernatural than this crap"
1,"20:19 - 21:06\n\nYou know what's even worse about Parallax's effects, is that THE F***ING TOY THAT PROMOTED THE MOVIE based on him looks more realistic!\n\nNo seriously, he's was creepy, he looked more true to the comics while still looking new, AND like the comics he looked like a living radioactive explosion!\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oyPBOYj8L._SL1300_.jpg\n\nIt's pretty bad when you realize the toy company could've made a more accurate Green Lantern movie than this."

I know he is doing a character and thats how he reacts to bad movies, but i don't find it funny or fitting for ALL reviews..\nI dont know.. Maybe it's just me who wants a reviewer to be more easy going and only have the movie-actors acting bad and silly"

-1,try Green Lantern: Emerald Knights is bettter that this movie
1,"Unpopular opinion; Green Lantern's special effects don't actually look that bad, I actually liked the colour work of the film and a lot of the shot composition, I thought Reynolds was halfway entertaining to watch despite the uninspired plot and Mark Strong was a pretty great Sinestro. People act like this movie was Catwoman or Elektra or any Batman movie before the Nolan Trilogy but it's problem isn't that the CG was bad (it really, really isn't), it's just that it's a 6/10 movie. I mean, Green Lantern was at least more memorable than Thor 2, every Hulk movie, any superhero film with a female lead before Wonder Woman (I've heard Tank Girl is good but I haven't watched it myself). Honestly Critic's over the top hate for the film annoyed me more than anything else, since he usually comes off as the voice of reason in the sea of cynical shit that is the internet."

-1,Review Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Side of Dimension movie Nostalgia Critic
1,It Old v. New when?!
1,I remember being so hyped for this movie but in the end it was a turd. I remember this came out two weeks after X-Men: First Class. I wasn't especially excited for that movie because the last X-Men prequel was also a turd though First Class was directed by the same bloke who made Kick-Ass so I was a little hopeful and it turned out to be really good and the best superhero flick of 2011 along with Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger.
1,It's an amazing how unappealing this film is Lmao classic
1,Doug looks more and more like Maynard James Keenan every time I see him...
1,"I didn't love this movie but I didn't despise it. Theres some bad CGI and writing but some of the scenes are decent enough. I loved Reynolds as Hal though, I thought he did a great job with what he had. I'd love to see him in another Green Lantern film...with a different writing crew and director. He would kill as a green lantern if given the opportunity to do it right. Can you imagine Reynolds nailing not only one comic book hero but two?"
-1,"Oddly enough, the spin off Animated Show: Green Lantern TAS is 1000x better quality and was only canceled because the movie tanked. Seriously, go watch it."

1,Loved the I.T Crowd reference.
-1,Honestly I’m somewhat shocked you didn’t get Ryan Reynolds to work with you on this.  Hard to believe he’d miss an opportunity to rip apart his second most hated role.
-1,The alein ring summons him? In every other GOOD telling the ring goes to find him! THAT WAS SO STUPID!!
0,That generic nerd character...\n\nOh look its NOT David Ayoade.

1,"Hey, Critic! If you want real nostalgia, and a burning need for some REALLY strong liquor to get you through a video, try a review of Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park. It's so bad, it's comical."
1,Say what you want about this shitty movie. But the introduction was not bad..

1,This was so good.   What a perfect dinner for October 1st.  I did it over the spaetzle instead though.   Cooking time was about 2.5 hours.
1,My first try at this is in the first hour simmer and you never said how the whole house is filled with such a wonderful the aroma.
1,Could I substitute beef with this easily? Where's the fat content on the shoulder highly important
1,"Just finished cooking this and it's a really great recipe. I reduced my sauce down a lot, to the point where it was basically a gravy. You get a great balance of sweetness from the cider and earthy savoriness from all the sage. And that little bit of vinegar not only reigns in the sweet cider but the acidity helps marinate the pork. I paired it with some butternut squash I roasted in dill and pepper. Thanks Chef John!"
0,Can you make Belgian carbonade ?
1,"From a butcher; that is a pork butt. The shoulder is the next section down. Yes, they are virtually interchangeable. However, they are in fact two different sub-primals, and if you're going to the length of getting friendly with a local butcher, it's worth note."
1,Give it the oooolllldd poka poka lol
1,"I made this yesterday, turned out so delicious. Did have to go for standard apple cider, didnt find sage leaves in 3 supermarkets (not even dried) So I went for a bit of a mix of thyme and rosemary. Which didn't give the same flavour but they sure did the trick for making it just as delicious. Have to keep my eye out for some fresh sage so I can make this properly, might even have to grow my own sage for the sake of trying it!"
1,Made this tonight. Wonderful and so so easy to make
1,I tried this. It was delicious. I added pig trotters to it so it was rich and so good.
1,nope... sorry... cant watch this right now. im not ready to be hungry yet... im saving this for breakfast lol
0,"I make pork in cider with apples every fall. The gravy is brown, savory and spicy. Cider goes into my squash soup too. Cider is under utilized in cooking,"

1,This is my new place to come to when I miss my dad reading me bed time poems.
0,"John,  I shouldn't watch your videos at 1 in the morning.  I'm now gonna go cook."
0,Would this work with beef for those who can't eat pork?
1,Stole my recipe except that I always leave it bone on.  You just can't replicate the feel and taste of collagen.  Way better than resorting to flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also add thick apple slices to the braise so when done you have a more less savory apple sauce
1,"John have you tried traditional English cider? Flat, strong, dry, tasting 100% of apples, tart, etc? I really think youd like it (maybe in recipes like this, or to drink...)"
-1,Takes sooo long to cook. I cooked it in a pressure cooker and took half an hour only.
1,we're not trying to make pulled pork here\nBut could we make pulled pork with a similar method?\npossibly thickening the sauce so it sticks more to the meat?
0,My heart never beats like it beats at this
1,I would love to see the squash recipe as well.
1,"Ok, going on next grocery list.  Can't wait to drink the sauce!\n\nJust had the billionaire frank and beans, never been a fan but Chef John's recipe is simple, quick and absolutely gonna be an added favorite to my house (I cheated in one spot and didn't use water, I used veg broth ; ) watch the vidy and you'll understand."
-1,Omg.....this is a alllllllllll day to cook 🍖 meat. Thanksgiving turkey 🦃 doesn't even take this long.! I'm going to give it a try though.

1,"You are the boss of your pork shoulder stewed in a creamy apple cider sauce!  Yes!  Want to learn more about Delicata squash for sure.  At first I thought it could have been sautéed apples which, of course, would have paired nicely with the pork shoulder.   Regardless Chef more on Delicata and other winter squash types.  Very underrated vegetable."

0,the cadence of this dude's voice bothers me
1,Did recipe with beef shoulder instead...worked great!
1,Pork shoulder is one of my favorite cuts from pork besides pork ribs and belly. Usually pork loins are too lean to my taste unless I make it sous vide.
1,Everything is better with a touch of Cayenne.

1,"Hello Chef John. I just made this and the pork was delicious, but the gravy is too tangy/vinger-y. Did I not reduce it enough? I reduced the liquid low and even added about 2 teaspoons of sugar because the sauce was very vinegar-y."

1,"chef john - i really must ask you this: do you have some religious objection to pressure cookers??  while this may not be the best example, but there are plenty where you could have used one and (imho) think you could have gotten better results, far faster.  you NEVER use pressure cookers.  what's up with that?\n\nanyone else with me on this?"
1,I am sure others commented on @  4:14  the sauce went from a liquid to a thicker more reduced sauce. Plus pan had more meat in after the edit.  Chef John I am rather disappointed in this presentation.

1,LMao. I would marry her
1,"I'm not usually very negative, but this is clearly stolen from Impractical Jokers and the audience was obviously a bunch of actors. I love Kate and she should totally star in some form of The Office but this would have been funnier if you'd trusted a group of employees to actually react to her. Half of the comedy comes from the audience."
1,Sixty-five percent of the time my cat wont look at me she said my eyes are glued to The Office so I promise in the warmer months we would play in the biggest liter box in the heart of the city. Please pretty i mean kitty my eyes grow large and weary.

-1,"1:48 - What's in the Center? This bit had me rolling, omg."
0,When ur partner made all the slides for the project and it was ur job to make the script
-1,"it nearly worked on me, but this very bad editor that chosed very bad acting-reactions in CC ruined it."
-1,Why does this remind me of a drunk Leslie Knope?
-1,i don't remember what the fuck this was

0,That me every time I present a PowerPoint
-1,we gotta Go to the south shore of long island lmaooo
1,And yet she makes more sense than Donald trump

1,what a wonderful woman
0, leave the humdah to me.... do not let this man into the office 😂😂
1,'What's in the center......................profit margin'  LOL

1,I'd be pleased to live in her dimples for eternity.
1,Kate's pretty funny! (like her 'white-trash girl abducted by aliens...again!)  And she likes girls...(me too!)
1,This is all very well articulated by comparison to the orange turd in the White House. Let's make her handle all them press conferences. We will have world peace.

1,"To Vanity Fair,\n\n65% of the planet is polluted because of paper for power-points. That may be a joke but would you please tell your audience how to fix the real problem of global deforestation and pollution?: Legalize marijuana. Hemp can make four times more paper per acre than trees. Hemp can also make biodegradable plastic. The legalization of marijuana will allow fields of industrial hemp to replace trees for paper, and petrochemicals for plastic, thereby ending deforestation and reducing pollution.\n\nPlease watch the 1942 US Department of Agriculture film, Hemp For Victory, and tell your national audience. This is our nation's past and our nation's future. Thank you."
1,this makes as much sense as any other office powerpoint presentation i've watched
-1,Funniest thing I've seen a long while. Made my day.
1,"She looks very feminine and nice here. I like it. Sometimes she forces a too strongish, boyish look which is not quite what I like seeing her in. By the way: I also broke by the elephant :D"

1,The best part about Jon's music videos is he features aesthetic sky and beauty of nature instead of girls jumping around in bikini. Such a gorgeous song and video
1,I  wish I could give you more than a like! your songs are AMAZING. Honestly please never stop this
1,Your my idol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.s you kinda look like an older version of my brother
1,"It's funny because the day before I looked to see if he released anything new or when he last released it, and then I saw this one and lost my shit"
1,"Hey Eden, great song! You are one of my favourite artists, I hope I will see you live one day. The song just kick ass'es, I listen to that song to get into flowstate before I start to grind. Keep up that great work.  BR"
1,"this is such a beautiful film, the song is pretty good too xD"

1,"Holy shit, the song and video fit so good together. It was worth to wait all this time for a new song. Continue with the great work Eden  😊"
1,Such a good song Love you Eden ❤️
1,Of course I hope there is a heaven.\nThe thought is extremely comforting to my fears of losing those I love.\nBut there's no reason to believe in any of the manmade gods.\nI don't see why I should compromise my morality and intellectual integrity for fear.\nIt's life.  None of us get out of it alive.
1,such a beautiful work of art - this is truly a masterpiece
1,make more music dont ever stop keep going
1,A beautiful song made by a beautiful man

1,"IM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU! \nPLEASE MARRY ME!\nYOU SAVED ALL THE LAST YEARS FOR ME AND NOW OMG!\nPLEASE BE MINE FOREVER, YOU ARE THE BEST!"
0,the bes music x
-1,IM SO LATE AND I CANT EVEN LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE NO HEADSET AHHH FUCK MY LIFE
1,I absolutely love the song but I think this is a rare case where the video detracts from the music. The whole time I'm trying to figure out the importance of the footage but realize there really isn't any. Yes it's beautiful and sure it can be argued that it's a similar feeling of the song but it's just not capturing me as much as the music itself.
1,"At first, I didn't like this song that much. I really like EDEN and I was like... maybe it is just me. But every single time I listen to it, I like it a little more. It has come to the point I like it as much as Rock + Roll"
0,I need you singing in Brazil!

-1,What I took away from this: Jack Del Rio knew just as little about football as a player as he did as a coach.
1,Absolutely awesome video Jon but you I think you missed an opportunity by not using the song Part of the Union by Strawb
-1,I've always been a Jon Bois fan but it bums me out how badly Vox pays their non big name employees. The article that came out surprised me but I guess it shouldn't have
0,Waited until my wife fell asleep so I could watch this without interruption.

1,Pretty long.
0,Jon Bois 🤤😂
1,"I don't know why Buddy Ryan even took the field. If he supported his striking players, why didn't he refuse to play replacements?"
1,"Unreal. New uploads from Bill Wurtz, Jon Bois, and Seth Everman in the span of 48 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*there IS someone out there looking out for me*"
1,This is honestly my favorite series on YouTube
-1,"I don’t get why this is a big deal at all, other than that it’s the only time anyone’s done it. People should always play till the end of the game, especially when you can improve your stats with another touchdown pass or something similar."
1,Hey welcome back again!
0,For some reason I think that these videos have a bit of horror in them
1,Haven't even watch it yet already know that its Pretty Good.
1,These videos are simply amazing content.
1,I love this series
1,Philadelphia Engels more like it imo
1,"John, You should make a video about June 4 1979.  ten cent beer night at Cleveland municipal stadium. Basically an Indians game turns into a drunken riot. It would be an amazing video. Please make it."
1,Please do a Pretty Good episode about the Panthers. I don't know what it would be on but please.
1,"yesssss! Pretty Good, the only thing that can make me care about sports"
0,Jon can you be my dad
-1,BRUH I DRIVE PAST THAT MT LAUREL HOTEL EVERYDAY AHHHHH it's gotta coco key and everything 😂
1,a video about labor power among nfl players- and why the idea that they make a lot of money should not mean they aren't considered labor- seems very pointed right now lol
-1,Further proving that the cowboys are the worst franchise in the NFL
1,Way better and more interesting than 30 for 30 films.
1,FINALLY A NEW PRETTY GOOD
0,Jon is officially the GOAT producer of short documentaries of any genre.
1,"Okay, this was good, but it wasn’t pre– wait..."

1,Always excited to see another episode of Pretty Good is up!!!
-1,It has been 31 long years..
1,I bet people that bet the over were really happy
1,"The music that gave you chills at 14:30? It's called Bold Action. It comes from Christopher Willis.\n\nThe reason Jon gave us this story in 2017? It's called solidarity. It comes from seeing football players unite and put their careers on the line to do the right thing. Nice one, Jon.\n\n(Okay, that second one is a guess.)"
1,"Some people may be impressed by the amount of history put into this video, but we can't forget that Jon's last episode of Pretty Good was before the strike. He was probably working on this as the strike was happening."
1,The only reason why I subbed to this channel\nTo watch Jon Bois' Pretty Good series
0,It's well documented by now that Cowboys ownership has always been nothing but insufferable

-1,"You know, you could've done this video without insulting parts of your audience that don't agree with you politically."
1,"9:10 That screeching eerie sound effect on any Jon Bois video is like a shot of heroin, Pretty Good"
1,Finding out Jon is a commie scum is the most heartbreaking thing
1,Good video. Was it necessary to make this with a political slant?
-1,"Some might say that if there were at least two pro football teams, there would be no need for a strike because the other team would have swooped in and offered the players what they wanted, some might say that monopolies are bad for the workers..."
1,20 minutes of hearing about the union for the rich celebrities to hear about a 7 second play. Sigh.   What I love the most is hearing about the plight of the player needing to make more money... yet the replacement who also has a family to support is a scab pos.
0,My granduncle was one of the replacement players.
0,Jfc is Jon a commie?
1,"I always enjoy Bois's work, and I mostly agree that unions are a good thing. But presuming that the only money an NFL player can make in his life is from his playing career seems like a huge example of cherrypicking. If you make 200,000 dollars in 4 years, you've got more financial mobility than 99% of the human race. I'm sorry, but I just can't feel sorry for you the same way I do for a factory worker making 7.50 an hour. You chose a dangerous profession, yes, but so did that factory worker, and he won't be 800k richer in 4 years at that factory. The situations are not the same."
1,"You do realize these strikes are inherently capitalist, right?  The idea of entertainers demanding to be paid hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars while industrial laborers make a penance is hardly what Marx had in mind.  In orthodox Marxism, you are supposed to be given assistance in accordance with your need (at least until the withering away of the state) and the value of a good/service is determined by the amount of labor required to produce it.  So, why should someone who only has to exert maximum effort one day a week, solely to provide entertainment, deserve more money than someone working multiple full-time jobs that actually produce a tangible and necessary good/service (i.e. food)?  Only capitalism can justify this - the NFL players generate more capital, because the perceived value of their labor and what it provides is worth more to people, and therefore they deserve a higher wage.\n\nThings like this are a sad testament to the fact that, while early Marxists at least did have an interest in the well-being of the working class, most modern Marxists are effete Ivory Tower intellectuals.  These communist-chic debutantes are so enwrapped in the capitalist way of thinking that they are unable to escape it even when ostensibly offering criticism and are only vaguely versed in the actual ideology of Marxism.  Not unlike when you see someone buying a Che Guevara shirt on a credit card at Urban Outfitters."

-1,Oh stop the bullshit and get some fucking work done you bunch of pieces of shit

1,Comment section these days is cancer! Such negativity on a little girl? see how cute and innocent she is. 💕
1,"Well all I'm gonna say is this isn't really that cute at all. Any child of this age that I know who's found out the sex of their baby siblings never cried over wanting a sibling of the same gender. I never did either. Looks to me this girl seems quite spoilt. Of course she's just a kid at the end of the day though, and I'm pretty certain she'll love her little brother once he arrives."
-1,Waaaay tooo many disgusting people here in the coments. You should feel ashamed!
1,No offense but she is rude I love my baby sister to bits yes I was expecting a brother but so what about gender she is cute no matter what that girl is spoilt mum needs tell her that her brother will be sad if she dont love him! Rude child. Idc if shes 3 she should know

-1,Should you HATE Hugh Heffner? THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEATH.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrCFrStey4
1,It is real. Look up what i told you to
1,"Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN. STOP with the praising of this man"
-1,"RIP Mr.Playboy! old man sucks by the way, i am really happy about his death, ugly skinny cunt he was i believe! RIP Mr. playboy! take care, bye bye XD Playboy sucks!

0,*REST IN PUSSY*
1,Jesus he sexualize women and other women believe they had to be perfect. Because of Playboy many women got plastic surgery porn got more and more popular it was just ridiculous. He's a pervert
1,"Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\n\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage. Pornography is a poor substitute for the bonding version of sex."

1,"Hi Gaby. Cool video. But I wanna adress your dissatisfaction with LBTQ+ videos being demonetized. I don't get why you rejoice over right-wing vids being demonetized, but don't understand why demonetizing LBTQ+ vids is a problem."

1,"Check out this video, the UltraPixel isn't real :) \nhttps://youtu.be/Cn4UMDpV0XA"
1,1:22 Is it normal that the word pixel isn't spelled with a upper case p?
0,"There has been three phones in code for a while now.  (They name them by fish, look it up)"
-1,YouTuber Breccia made the fake vid. And this guy Mrwhostheboss fell for it hard. More like Mrwhosthedumbass.

1,"If it's real, I'm very worried, very very worried."
1,"If anyones gonna have it, it would be google anyway is not a correct argument in my opinion. Google almost never use a hardware technology the first time in the market. \n\nSo if anyones gonna have it, it would be some unknown chinese manufacturer, some known chinese manufacturer like xiaomi, Samsung, LG, now maybe Google, then other android devices.\n\nNice presentation btw."
0,Ultra pixel probably means that it's gonna have a ultra pixel camera on the HTC model....maybe even the the larger LG model....I doubt they switch up and make 3 phones
0,"a grain of salt, not a pinch"
-1,Ha everyone with half a brain knew that this was fake.
0,Why is the laptop a MacBook???
1,So... it socially acceptable to copy what Apple do to replace any frontal buttons with gestures now?
0,Nintendo will flag this? Background image of their IP.
1,"I really like the way you explain everything in your video. Specifically, your voice which isn't, compared to some others, very loud and over-enthusiastic. It's really nice to listen to. And I don't mean this in a 'strange' way. You really have something."
1,"I can't wait to pay around $1000, I'm super excited."
1,Ignore them! We are here ♥ ♥ now and forever.
0,and the Google employee is using MacBook pro? loool
1,When your favorite companies start trying to skrew each other cough cough Samsung(screens) and google (software)

0,Android devices already had no physical home buttons

0,Why don't blokes I know have accents like that 😫
1,"If it's a legitimate phone, given Google's current bullshit trend it'll probably cost upwards of a grand. Go fuck yourself, Giggle."
1,"If LG can do the LG V30. \n\nI’d say Google can do the Ultra Pixel. \n\nI mean it would be the best phone on the market perhaps even beating the iPhone X. \n\nStock Android with all the best bits from Samsung, LG and others. \n\nThis could be an Apple killer especially if it’s priced closer to the Samsung S8 Plus. \n\nA lag free Android device with amazing specs. \n\n🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇"
1,"If this is true, and it seems like it's too good to be true, but if it's true, it is going to be the biggest slap in the face for Apple ever. It would basically mean the phone can do everything the X was supposed to, but can't"
1,It bugs me that Google is trying to be the Apple Android. Even using stuff that's not as good like gestures. And if there's also no headphone jack then I'm done. It would show that they don't know anything about their consumers. Only trying to follow what Apple is doing. Also raise the price even more with squeeze technology. Probably makes the battery smaller.
0,That person works at Google but used a Macbook Pro and Safari... Alright
0,3 phones per year now?? Why...
1,Your voice is very soft and sweet\nAnd your videos are just awesome\nBut missing the old intro

0,"Because all phones no longer have bezels, they literally all look the same. So it doesnt make any difference anymore..."
1,you are great dude. I'm now curious about ultra pixel
0,Shot from a Google office? They use MacBooks in Google?
0,Your hands are trying to gain my trust but my brain won’t let it happen......O_o
0,The photos on a MacBook google would not use a MacBook
1,I hope it turns out to be true
0,This is trash....
-1,"How would they know it’s not true, when they were children at the time"
-1,"Robert Kardashian passed away years ago so I don't think it's ok to talk about HIS opinion in a book, considering he can not respond. Also I think Caitlyn knew she was gonna hurt Kim, Kourt and Khloe 's feelings talking bad about their dead dad.. it's super cruel to do something like that.."
-1,that book was a long time ago why are they still talking about it its irrelevant at this point?
-1,At least these gals stand for each other i like it
1,"I'm traditional why would Caitlyn defend the tradition that clearly does not accept her! seriously, she needs to stop being so close minded. Which is silly to say but clearly she is. Just because she's transgender does not make her a good person."
1,Whatever they're saying or talking about… but don't talk about their dead dad's actions to sell a few more copies. LOW.
-1,"Imagine if you had a secret and you were desperate to tell somone, who would you tell, a reliable 50 year old man, or your frivolous kids?"
0,I did the same thing check it out!
1,"Kim--Your words are spoken, my words are sung! You fear, I watch. You talk, I take action! I look, you hide! I dance in the light, you crossed over.  I've been to hell and back, you've been to target! I've died in this life in many ways, you fear death! I love with my heart, you love with your money! I'm loyal, you're a coward!  I make sense, you spend cents! I've felt death in my hands, you've felt nothing!"
-1,"They are all fake asf. They surgery made, rich brought up, fake women"
0,I'm so over this show
0,This is nothing but bullshit
-1,Read the book and there was absolutely nothing wrong with it
-1,Wearing the fur of a slaughtered animal is bad enough but to do it in southern California? Wtf? Lol.
1,"Robert, is the only Kardashian I respect. If he were alive, he'd probably commit suicide because of the sluts he has to call family"
-1,Is that fake fur i hope..
1,"someone has to be lying. my fingers are pointing to the Kardashians, not the jenners. \n\nsome of what they say might be true, but lets be honest, its THEIR show so they can say anything adn the fans wont know a single thing thats wrong."
1,"I would not be surprised, if every single Kardashian-Jenner person (even Bruce... Caitlyn) got on a conference call and said What can we do to make this season spicy..."
-1,They are all deformed each and every day.. wonder how those fake asses will look when they become senior citizens 🙄
0,Can't wait for Sunday!!
0,"Dear God, Why are these SLAGS Still on t.v????"
0,Omg! Who makes Kourtney's sweater? I want it. 😢
1,How do they know if it's a lie or not? Kris knew he was guilty. Robert was good friends with oj so even if he knew he was guilety he would defend him so I believe Caitlyn is telling the truth and these girls are just trying to find something interesting to say on their boring shows. They don't know whether it's true wether or not their dad believe OJ. Their dad would have to say he believed in him no matter what and he's not going to tell his kids at their ages because kids blab
-1,"It's pathetic that the Kardashian's are famous because O.J. Simpson killed his wife and Kim Kardashian did a porno video with her ex-boyfriend and it got on the internet, Kim Kardashian sure looked stupid when she thought she was going to be a centerfold in Playboy wearing clothes, she also looked stupid when she was suing because someone looked like her!"
1,It's so shady how Kim got pregnant with north while she was still married to chris new flash Kim your not a good person either lol
0,"The fact that they talk about BRUCE, like BRUCE isn't BRUCE!?!?!?"
0,Kim Kardashian calls Caitlyn a Liar over his book
0,likE . tO sElL a bOok . yOu'rE gOnnA mAkE sOmEThing uP ?
1,if your dad didnt think oj was guilty he was seriously retarded. There was DNA evidence that proves it. Robert Kardashian was a smart guy I'm guessing its more likely he wanted to make sure his friend at least got a fair trial but no way he didnt know OJ was guilty by the end
1,Ok no one cares about these rich weirdos. Find people who have real talent. This is a really disgusting example of  how not to 1) Be a mother 2)  Raise your daughters 3) There's a term for the Kardashees on the streets of L.A. ... SKONKAS!!!
1,when is khloe going to admit she got her butt done? i still love her though
-1,can this family just become extinct
0,Everyone who watches this show should be shot in the head.
1,Wherever the Kardashians go...Herpes is sure to follow.

0,These chicks look like they were made by the crayola factory!
0,Why couldn't they be taken and not Hugh Hefner😣😣😣😂
1,Can say that again. Bruce lived his whole life as a lie so now he has to make stuff up to feel normal. He also may be compulsive.
-1,"Sorry but Robert Kardashian was a highly intelligent lawyer, he knew O.J. was guilty"
-1,"Robert Kardashian knew, he carried out the hanging bag of  clothes. Smart men don't become stupid, even for 1 minute"
1,Fuk people who dish ur family ! Specially who do no wrong reality TV hello
1,"Dang these Kardashian's are like a friggin Hydra monster.  You cut off one head, and out pops 100 more. 😱"
-1,No sweetheart ya father was the liar. But that lie was the only solid contribution Kardashian name has made to the Black community outside of yall children and we thank you.
1,How many animals for this coat ? It's just discusting.
-1,Calling a man her is like calling an apple an orange. The DNA strands were programmed to grow a pair of testicles outside the body and produce semen. What next you go tell me fire not hot? facepalm
-1,Robert did know OJ was guilty. The rest....🤷🏽‍♀️
-1,"Even if he did think OJ was guilty, the point was that he told caitlyn which I doubt happened 😂😂😂"
-1,I believe her... OJ was guilty!!!
1,Wow I love this item. http://amzn.to/2xJYbzw

1,Why Kim always coming for my girl cait for she really need to back tf off🙄😒🤦🏼‍♀️ #tierd
1,How old were they again when the O.J. situation happened ??
1,They added this drama just to keep the KUWTK series alive...
-1,"All these people complaining about the fur 100% eat or consume animal products in some way, settle down lil hypocrites"
0,Kim definitely shouldn't be talking. She lied to the world about her marriage to Kris Humphries. It was fake for tv. She has pulled many fake publicity stunts to stay relevant so why tf is she being a hypocrite???!
0,where's kanye\n\n\n\n\nnever mind he left

1,"I use to like this show in the first 3 seasons. Very funny and comical. But now it’s to a point where they’re picking their nails, sitting down all day talking about god knows what, the climax of the show is them actually raising their voice and breaking a sweat. I mean come on."
1,I absolutely love this show!  The amount of heart and old fashioned charm in every episode is really refreshing.
0,"omg the actors in this show are unreal, liam neeson in the last one, now this..."

-1,"Wow, Liam Neeson, Charlize Theron, who's next. Let's see umm Patrick Stewart, Milia Kunis and Patrick Warburton why not lol"
1,"I love this show,  last nights episode perfectly embodied the spirit and heart of Star Trek,  this is the first show in a long time that I actually look forward to and make a point to catch on television every week.  That being said, I am wondering about Alaras eyebrows, and how sometimes she has them and sometimes she doesn't, will this be brought up as some funny quirk about her character? or did the make-up process just get tiring?  I like the look of her with the eyebrows personally."

1,"This is a great show, good job!"
1,love this show so much! and am I the only one who ships gordon and alara?
1,ty.......make ST great again!
1,Awesome show! When are you going to bring in Mike Henry? Or how about Mark Hamill?
1,In episode 4 they used the musical score from ST The Motion picture. The scene where the Orville shuttle docks with the 2000 yr old ship is the same music when the Enterprise enters V'ger's energy cloud.
0,Gotta subcribe in hopes that FOX wont cancel this one.
1,Amazing show... Real star trek vibe.. Love it!
1,"I've never really seen Star Trek and Space Drama has never really been my thing. However, I took a shot with this show and I dont regret it. Seriously, the first episode was meh but interested me enough to keep watching, so I did and by the fourth episode I was completely enthralled with this show. There so few character-centric series out there with LIKEABLE characters. And even less that take the time to create the feeling of watching something new every week. The idea of these characters I like, traveling to different places and visiting all new people is just wonderful. The fact they keep throwing these big name actors on the show doesn't matter to me one bit. The fact they keep building on these great characters is what makes me come back each week. I can't wait to see more and I really hope this show continues far into the future."
1,This show will cancel it Star Trek Discovery.Cuz this show has real  spirit of Star Trek thats what I felt.Unfortunately JJ. Abrams universe killed ST...Thank god we have Orville now.I am ready for watch 10 or more seasons.Please dun make any mistake like others did before (as Serenity) and keep goin with this show FOX.
0,that one dislike is from hamailtin
1,I just read this article on Forbes on how the critics must be crazy or perhaps that they don't like Seth... but if I have one hour of free time to watch a show and I have to pick between ST Discovery (which I am also following and enjoy so far)  and Orville;  Orville wins!
1,happy that I can watch this online on fox with out issues :) and yeah this show is so bright and shiny and happy!
1,It's the exact same video as the other upload.
-1,"Is norm MacDonald's jello monster, who is desperately alone on the Orville, going to take off with charleze Theron at the end of the episode? According to IMDb, this episode is norm's last. Maybe she's actually into his species."
1,that uniform in the first scene!!! XD
1,"Yes, it rocks - or it will - Orville :-)"
0,Yesssssssssssssssssss!
0,Тот странный случай когда пародия лучше оригинала ))))
-1,Holy Crap
0,Yes...
1,Can we get two episodes a week please?  =D
0,yay charlize
1,Oh its gonna be surprising alright cause eyebrowless Alara is back lol
0,"Alara's eyebrows have gone away again... I guess it's because Charlize Theron's on the ep, to not threaten Charlize's hotness or something."
1,"The show doesn't have true content, or a refreshing twist to scifi, so it needs famous guest stars. Charlize Theron is cool enough to play a character in an uncool show. But for how long will this work?\nWho's next to make up for the poor show? Obama? Bette Middler? Or some confused transvestite? Another example of weird sexual behaviour marked as cultural change? \n Or will we see another episode with ugly guys sitting naked on their eggs? I hope not.\nSeth MacFarlaine can make this show, because he earned a fortune to his network. But in the end this lame vessel will be decommissioned, and rightly so. A great opportuntiy will be missed to bring scifi to a new level. Adolescent jokes won't do the trick, Charlize Theron won't either. It's a real shame..."
0,"In Maya, teal is the border."
-1,These guys are such morons. Especially Sliva is such a tool. I can't stand the guy.
1,"I hope we get to play the riverboat robbery massacre that is hinted at so many times in the first game by Marston.\n **Spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 1**\n\nThis is when the group split pretty much, or at very least list some ppl incl. leaving Marston for dead.   I'm really hoping the the line said in the 1st trailer is Morgan telling Marston basically if it all goes wrong just turn and don't look back, maybe even that's said right before the riverboat heist is about to go down.  \n\nAnyways so excited, but IGN you guys should do your damn research before speaking."
0,How will they work shark cards into this...
1,"Red Dead Revolver\nRed Dead Redemption\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nIdk would have been nice to have a new word, but I guess corporate marketing has its way yet again. Shark cards much"
0,Was that John Marston's voice at time :55 in the trailer?  I think it was....  Omg...
0,Is it for PC though.?
0,What does Morgan say to the guy at the beginning when he tastes the food cooked in the camp?
0,30 second unskippable ad..... guess I won't be watching this video
1,"Two people who seem haven't a clue about rdr1 , and are guessing what is happening now it's a clear prequel noticed the moment I seen trailer that's all that needs to be said now we wait till next info"
1,When is bully 2 coming i am excited about that ☺
1,magnificent 7 was a great movie
0,"Looking like mafia 3 especially with them swamplands, wheres the desert?"
-1,"For those asking about Xbox 360, That console is dead, you've had 4 years to buy a current gen console, no more Rockstar games will be releasing on Xbox 360 or PS3."
1,Why upload the first 33 minutes of nothing?
-1,Marty your not sure if this is a prequel or a sequel? Here is a little help. Dutch is mentioned in the video. By the end of Red Dead Redemption what happened to Dutch? So if he is here then this time period shown in the video must be before RD1. If your not sure what happened to Dutch by the end of RD1 check the wiki he details exactly what happens to him and how if he is in the game it confirms that this time period MUST be before RD1 as a prequel.
0,I seen this trailer
0,Its not a sequel you ignoranuses
-1,Rockstar should use this to make a The Dark Tower game.
-1,I'll keep her in black. On your behalf Such a boss line!
0,"If you get to play between all 5 members of Ducth's gang in different locations like GTA5, i'm gonna ejaculate and shart on myself simultaneously."
1,yes completely ignore the native american.......idiots
1,Is the boy in the trailer a young John Marston.? It would make sense in terms of time scale
1,I swear this game better then the GTA series
-1,This is what happens when you put two idiots in charge..
0,"It's just a cut scene of cowboys eating at camp, this is how games get hyped beyond all reason, rockstar games or not."
0,It's comes out in auttum
-1,there was a morality system in red dead redemption
1,"Hour long stream just for a trialer lol, just show the trialer"
0,Maybe R* will show off online and gameplay at PSX this year since they have a partnership with Sony.
1,lol Marty was all over the place in this video
0,I can finally hang myself in peace.
1,I really hope it’s not all online
-1,That guy with the glasses said Oh so van der linde hes like a side character not like Javier escuella serious? The leader of the gang?
0,We actually have both american alligators and american crocodiles in Florida
1,Gameplay next game of the year probably :D
0,How did they not recognize Dutch
-1,"I like him, but Marty is totally off base. It's uncontrolled incoherent speculation. Maybe it's like Destiny? There was literally no hint of multiplayer in this. Also, Dutch is the leader of the gang, and the story of RDR is Marsten hunting Dutch. Making him one of the most important/significant characters of that game."
1,"Uh, Dutch was not a side character in RDR. He was the main villain. Also, Morgan literally says Dutch's name at the end of the trailer. The guy on the right has no idea what he's talking about."
1,"No game no hype, those are the rules."
-1,Kinda reminds me of red dead revolver due to the red bandana that red had around his neck
0,not digging the graphics and lip syncing. hopefully gets a day 1 patch
1,"We won’t see anything more from rdr 2 until next Feb, March or may be April."
1,hour long video for a trailer thanks IGN
-1,"They told you it centers around Arthur Morgan, it's not going to center around multiple characters..."
0,He speaks to a younger dutch at the end so i'm guessing it's a prequel!!
1,Literally the two most uniformed people to cover this reveal. Gees...
0,I think John Marston is the boy with his morning mother
-1,How do so many not remember who dutch van der linde is??? he was marstons target through the whole game!!!
1,Dutch is in the game. This is obviously a prequel lol
1,"If there's going to be RDR Online I am hoping Rockstar can fix the loading screen times, connectivity, as well the firefights it kinda disrupts the fun when you shoot someone only for his corpse to start shooting at you..."
1,"“I see they’re now using “II” in the title... I think it was 2 before if I can remember correctly” \nHey guys, look behind you. lol"
0,Dude said the difference between crocs and alligators is that alligators are in america?🤔🤔🤔🤔
1,These guys did not even play the first red dead redemption
1,There are crocodiles in America as well...but they are rare and only in the very very Southern Portion of Florida
0,I only care about multiplayer!
0,can preorder now. o yeah were close
0,"throwing my money at the screen, want to pre-order, but can't find it on STEAM????????????"
-1,are they really calling this red dead redemption 2? :c
0,"Its a prequel, unless there is another Dutch."
-1,it could be as late as june.
0,Can we have Indians in this one
-1,"You are such idiots van der lind was the leader of the gang of williamson and javier escuella, and he appears in the trailer as the politician they thought"
1,"hd remaster for la noire... LOL That game does not need an upgrade, it still looks better then most games coming out these years."
0,Boy I hope its not like Destiny
1,single player dlcs will always be better than online ones! always!
-1,Its impossible to be a sequel becuase that politician is being called Dutch by Mr.Morgan (unless Dutch survived which I highly doubt)
-1,3 title's im into\nIn 2018\nMonster hunter world\nGod of war\nAnd red dead 2
0,yo I cant wait for it
0,"Marty's hands keep shaking, is that hype?"
-1,DID YOU HAVE TO PUT A TIMER IN THE BEGINNING
1,"The train robberies were clearly a MUST, thats practically a trademark for bandits back in the day"
-1,Don't hate me this is my first red dead redemption game I've heard about but it looks really good.
1,Best open world game ever Coming right up
1,"RDR2 will look and play best on Xbox One X!\nStay tuned, pc to run this @ 0p & 0fps."
1,"Anybody else screaming at these two dudes because they kept talking about maybe Dutch is in the game when we clearly seen him at the end of the trailer when they played it the first time you recognize him immediately plus he asked Arthur Do you have my back? to which Arthur replies always Dutch.! Dutch van der Linde looks exactly the same except younger , longer hair and not on the Run so he looks more taken care of.."
